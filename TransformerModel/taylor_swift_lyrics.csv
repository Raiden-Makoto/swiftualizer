"""Slut!"" (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)","[Verse 1]
Flamingo pink, Sunrise Boulevard
Clink, clink, being this young is art
Aquamarine, moonlit swimmin' pool
What if all I need is you?
[Pre-Chorus]
Got love-struck, went straight to my head
Got lovesick all over my bed
Love to think you’ll never forget
Handprints in wet cement
Adorned with smoke on my clothes
Lovelorn and nobody knows
Love thorns all over this rose
I'll pay the price, you won't
[Chorus]
But if I’m all dressed up
They might as well be lookin' at us
And if they call me a slut
You know it might be worth it for once
And if I'm gonna be drunk
I might as well be drunk in love
[Verse 2]
Send the code, he's waitin' there
The sticks and stones they throw froze mid-air
Everyone wants him, that was my crime
The wrong place at the right time
And I break down, then he's pullin' me in
In a world of boys, he's a gentleman
[Pre-Chorus]
Got love-struck, went straight to my head (Straight to my head)
Got lovesick all over my bed (Over my bed)
Love to think you’ll never forget
We’ll pay the price, I guess
[Chorus]
But if I'm all dressed up (If I’m all dressed up)
They might as well be lookin' at us (Lookin' at us)
And if they call me a slut (If they call me a slut)
You know it might be worth it for once (Worth it for once)
And if I'm gonna be drunk
I might as well be drunk in love
[Bridge]
Half asleep
Takin’ your time in the tangerine
Neon light, this is luxury
You're not sayin' you're in love with me
But you're goin' to
Half awake
Takin' your chance, it's a big mistake
I said, ""It might blow up in your pretty face""
I'm not sayin', ""Do it anyway"" (Do it anyway)
But you're going to
[Outro]
(Up)
And if they call me a (Slut)
You know it might be worth it for once
And if I'm gonna be (Drunk)
I might as well be drunk in love"
22 (Taylor's Version),"[Verse 1]
It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Uh-uh, uh-uh
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Uh-uh, uh-uh
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, oh-oh
[Chorus]
I don't know about you
But I'm feelin' twenty-two
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will bе alright if
We just keep dancin' like we'rе
Twenty-two
Twenty-two
[Verse 2]
It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids
Uh-uh, uh-uh (Who's Taylor Swift anyway? Ew)
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreamin'
Instead of sleepin'
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time, oh-oh
[Chorus]
(Hey)
I don't know about you
But I'm feelin' twenty-two
Everything will be alright if (Ooh)
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if (Alright)
We just keep dancin' like we're
Twenty-two (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Twenty-two (I don't know about you)
Twenty-two
Twenty-two (Ooh)
[Post-Chorus]
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleepin'
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you
[Bridge]
Ooh, oh
Yeah, hey, yeah
[Chorus]
(Hey)
I don't know about you (I don't know about you)
But I'm feelin' twenty-two
Everything will be alright if (Ooh, oh-oh)
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me (You don't know about me)
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancin' like we're (Dance like we're twenty-two)
Twenty-two (Ooh, woah-oh-oh-oh)
Twenty-two (Dancin' like)
Twenty-two (Yeah, yeah)
Twenty-two (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Post-Chorus]
It feels like one of those nights (Twenty-two)
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights (Twenty-two)
We won't be sleepin'
It feels like one of those nights (Twenty-two)
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you"
Afterglow,"[Verse 1]
I blew things out of proportion, now you're blue
Put you in jail for something you didn’t do
I pinned your hands behind your back, oh
Thought I had reason to attack, but no
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves
Chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til there’s no us
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
It's on your face, and I'm to blame, I need to say
[Chorus]
Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don’t wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don’t wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it’s all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow
[Verse 2]
It's so excruciating to see you low
Just wanna lift you up and not let you go
This ultraviolet morning light below
Tells me this love is worth the fight, oh
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I lived like an island, punished you with silence
Went off like sirens, just crying
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
It’s on your face, don't walk away, I need to say
[Chorus]
Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
I'm sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow
[Bridge]
Tell me that you're still mine
Tell me that we'll be just fine
Even when I lose my mind
I need to say
Tell me that it's not my fault
Tell me that I'm all you want
Even when I break your heart
I need to say
[Chorus]
Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow"
All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault),"[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh
[Chorus]
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, 
your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the 
tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to
[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah
[Bridge]
Well, maybe we got 
lost in translation
, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
[Verse 4]
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""
[Verse 5]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
[Verse 6]
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well
[Outro]
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it"

All You Had To Do Was Stay (Taylor's Version),"[Intro]
(Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)
[Verse 1]
People like you always want back
The love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you
When you say you've changed
The more I think about it now
The less I know
All I know is that you drove us
Off the road
[Chorus]
(Stay) Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand, then
Why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
(Stay) Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late, well, could've been easy
All you had to do was (Stay)
[Post-Chorus]
All you had to do was (Stay)
All you had to do was (Stay)
All you had to do was (Stay)
All you had to do was stay
[Verse 2]
Here you are now, callin' me up
But I don't know what to say
I've been pickin' up the pieces
Of the mess you made
People like you always want back
The love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever
When you say goodbye
[Chorus]
(Stay) Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand, then
Why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
(Stay) Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late, well, could've been easy
All you had to do was (Stay)
[Post-Chorus]
All you had to do was (Stay)
All you had to do was (Stay)
All you had to do was (Stay, stay, stay, stay)
[Bridge]
Let me remind you
This was what you wanted (Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
You ended it
You were all I wanted (Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
But not like this
Not like this, not like this
Oh, all you had to do was

(Stay) Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand, then
Why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?

Anti-Hero,
Babe (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault),"[Intro]
What about your promises, promises?
What about your promises, promises, promises? No
[Verse 1]
What a shame
Didn't wanna be the one that got away, yeah
Big mistake, you broke the sweetest promise
That you never should have made
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm here on the kitchen floor
You call, but I won't hear it
You said, ""No one else""
How could you do this, babe?
[Chorus]
(What about your promises, promises?)
You really blew this, babe
We ain't getting through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
(This is the last time, this is the last time)
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
(What about your promises, promises, promises? No)
[Verse 2]
What a waste
Takin' down the pictures and the plans we made, yeah
And it's strange how your face doesn't look so innocent
Your secret has its consequence and that's on you, babe
[Pre-Chorus]
I break down every time you call
We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball
We said, ""No one else""
How could you do this, babe?
[Chorus]
(Oh, what about your promises, promises?)
You really blew this, babe
We ain't getting through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
(This is the last time, this is the last time)
This is the last time I'll ever call you
[Bridge]
Since you admitted it (Oh-oh), I keep picturin' (Oh-oh)
Her lips on your neck (Oh-oh), I can't unsee it
I hate that because of you, I can't love you, babe
What a shame, didn't want to be the one that got away
How could you do this, babe? (Babe)
[Chorus]
You really blew this, babe (Babe)
We ain't getting through this one, babe (Babe)
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe (Babe)
(This is the last time, this is the last time)
This is the last time I'll ever call you

You call, but I won't hear it
You said, ""No one else""
We ain't getting through this one, babe

We said, ""No one else""
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe (Babe)

Back To December (Taylor's Version),"[Verse 1]
I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
[Pre-Chorus]
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die
[Chorus]
So, this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night
""
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time
[Verse 2]
These days, I haven't been sleeping
Stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughin' from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall
[Pre-Chorus]
And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye
[Chorus]
So, this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you, sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
[Bridge]
I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinkin'
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So, if the chain is on your door, I understand
[Chorus]
But this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you, sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
[Outro]
All the time"
Bad Blood (Taylor's Version),"[Chorus]
'
Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
[Verse 1]
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin
What was shiny? Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me
Where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughin' right at me
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I
[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad lovе
So take a look what you've done
'Causе, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
[Verse 2]
Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars on my back from your knife
So don't think it's in the past
These kinda wounds, they last and they last
Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So if you're comin' my way, just don't
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I
[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love

Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (Ghosts)
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes (Hey)
You say sorry just for show (Hey)
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (Hey), mmm
If you love like that, blood runs cold

Begin Again (Taylor's Version),"[Verse 1]
Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels, but I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song, but I do, I do
[Verse 2]
I walked in, expectin' you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave, I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is, but I do
[Chorus]
And you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spendin' the last eight months
Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wеdnesday in a café, I watched it begin again
[Verse 3]
You said you nеver met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you, but I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm comin' off a little shy, 
but I do
[Chorus]
But you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spendin' the last eight months
Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again
[Bridge]
And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I wanna talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past
[Chorus]
'Cause you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spendin' the last eight months
Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again
[Outro]
On a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again"
Bejeweled,"[Verse 1]
Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind
Didn't notice you walkin' all over my peace of mind
In the shoes I gave you as a present
Puttin' someone first only works when you're in their top five
And by the way, I'm goin' out tonight
[Chorus]
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, ""Do you have a man?""
I could still say, 
""I don't remember""
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put mе in the basement
Whеn I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real, I polish up real nice
[Post-Chorus]
Nice
[Verse 2]
Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl (Too good of a girl)
Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve
I think it's time to teach some lessons
I made you my world (Huh), have you heard? (Huh)
I can reclaim the land
And I miss you (Miss you), but I miss sparklin' (Nice)
[Chorus]
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, ""Do you have a man?""
I could still say, ""I don't remember""
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real, I polish up real nice
[Post-Chorus]
Nice
[Bridge]
Sapphire tears on my face
Sadness became my whole sky
But some guy said my aura's moonstone
Just 'cause he was high
And we're dancin' all night
And you can try to change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What's a girl gonna do?
A diamond's gotta shine
[Chorus]
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer (Shimmer)
And when I meet the band
They ask, ""Do you have a man?""
I could still say, ""I don't remember""
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real (Nice), I polish up real nice
[Outro]
And we're dancin' all night
And you can try to change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What's a girl gonna do? What's a girl gonna do?
I polish up nice
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer"
Better Man (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault),"[Verse 1]
I know I'm probably better off on my own
Than lovin’ a man who didn't know what he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic
[Pre-Chorus]
I wish it wasn't 4AM, standin’ in the mirror
Saying to myself, ""You know you had to do it""
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run
[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
[Verse 2]
I know I'm probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind at any given minute
And it was always on your terms, I waited on every careless word
Hoping they might turn sweet again like it was in the beginning
[Pre-Chorus]
But your jealousy, oh, I can hear it now
Talking down to me like I'd always be around
Push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun
Oh, you never thought I'd run
[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
[Bridge]
I hold onto this pride because, these days, it's all I have
And I gave to you my best
And we both know you can't say that
[Breakdown]
I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we would've become if you were a better man
We might still be in love if you were a better man
You would've been the one if you were a better man
[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
(Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again)
We might still be in love, if you were a better man
(But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man)
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
[Outro]
We might still be in love if you were a better man
You would’ve been the one if you were a better man"
Better Than Revenge (Taylor's Version),"[Intro]
Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did (Ha)
Haha, time for a little revenge
[Verse 1]
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer, and
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say ""Sabotage""
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with (Oh)
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealin' from
[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
He was a moth to the flame
She was holding the matches, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge (Revenge), ha
[Verse 2]
She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
, and
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
They didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
That no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)
[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
He was a moth to the flame
She was holding the matches, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge (Haha)
[Bridge]
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard?
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but I always get the last word
Woah (Come on, can you take it back? Come on)
[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think (No)
She's an actress, woah (You know that you deserve this)
He was a moth to the flame
She was holding the matches, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge
[Outro]
(Come on) Do you still feel like you know what you're doin'?
'Cause I don't think you do, oh (No, no, no, no)
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing? (No)
I don't think you do, I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause (Come on, come on)
Come on, show me how much better you are (Oh, oh)
(So much better, yeah?)
So you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you could say ""Sabotage"""
Bigger Than The Whole Sky,"[Verse 1]
No words appear before me in the aftermath
Salt streams out my eyes and into my ears
Every single thing I touch becomes sick with sadness
'Cause it's all over now, all out to sea
[Chorus]
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And I've got a lot to pine about
I've got a lot to live without
I'm never gonna meet
What could've been, would've been
What should've been you
What could've been, would've been you
[Verse 2]
Did some bird flap its wings ovеr in Asia?
Did some force take you bеcause I didn't pray?
Every single thing to come has turned into ashes
'Cause it's all over, it's not meant to be
So I'll say words I don't believe
[Chorus]
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And I've got a lot to pine about
I've got a lot to live without
I'm never gonna meet
What could've been, would've been
What should've been you
[Bridge]
What could've been, would've been you
What could've been, would've been
What should've been you
What could've been, would've been you
(What could've been, would've been you)
[Chorus]
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And I've got a lot to pine about
I've got a lot to live without
I'm never gonna meet
What could've been, would've been
What should've been you"
Blank Space (Taylor's Version),"[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
""Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"" Ayy
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dyin' to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth thе pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tеll you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
[Verse 2]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessin', like
""Oh, my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Oh)
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless (Oh-oh), mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (Insane)
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
[Bridge]
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over (Over), mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (I'm insane)
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game (Love the game)
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Yeah)
We'll take this way too far (Ooh)
It'll leave you breathless, mm

And I'll write your name"
But Daddy I Love Him,"[Verse 1]
I forget how the West was won
I forget if this was ever fun
I just learned these people only raise you
To cage you
Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best
Clutchin' their pearls, sighing, ""What a mess""
I just learned these people try and save you
'Cause they hate you
[Pre-Chorus]
Too high a horse
For a simple girl
To rise above it
They slammed the door
On my whole world
The one thing I wanted
[Chorus]
Now I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
Scrеamin', ""But, Daddy, I love him""
I'm havin' his baby
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm tellin' him to floor it through thе fences
No, I'm not coming to my senses
I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want
[Verse 2]
Dutiful daughter, all my plans were laid
Tendrils tucked into a woven braid
Growin' up precocious sometimes means
Not growin' up at all
He was chaos, he was revelry
Bedroom eyes like a remedy
Soon enough, the elders had convened
Down at the city hall
[Pre-Chorus]
""Stay away from her""
The saboteurs
Protested too much
Lord knows the words
We never heard
Just screeching tires and true love
[Chorus]
And I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
Screamin', ""But, Daddy, I love him""
I'm havin' his baby
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm tellin' him to floor it through the fences
No, I'm not coming to my senses
I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want
[Post-Chorus]
I'll tell you something right now
I'd rather burn my whole life down
Than listen to one more second of all this bitchin' and moanin'
I'll tell you something 'bout my good name
It's mine alone to disgrace
I don't cater to all these vipers dressed in empath's clothing
[Bridge]
God save the most judgmental creeps
Who say they want what's best for me
Sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I'll never see
Thinkin' it can change the beat
Of my heart when he touches me
And counteract the chemistry
And undo the destiny
You ain't gotta pray for me
Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy
If all you want is gray for me
Then it's just white noise, and it's just my choice
[Verse 3]
There's a lot of people in town that I
Bestow upon my fakest smiles
Scandal does funny things to pride, but brings lovers closer
We came back when the heat died down
Went to my parents and they came around
All the wine moms are still holdin' out, but fuck 'em, it's over
[Chorus]
Now I'm dancin' in my dress in the sun and
Even my daddy just loves him
I'm his lady
And, oh my God, you should see your faces
Time, doesn't it give some perspective?
And, no, you can't come to the wedding
I know it's crazy, but he's the one I want
[Post-Chorus]
I'll tell you something right now
You ain't gotta pray for me
Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy
(He was chaos, he was revelry)
If all you want is gray for me
Then it's just white noise, and it's my choice
[Outro]
Screamin', ""But, Daddy, I love him""
I'm having his baby
No, I'm not
But you should see your faces
But, oh my God, you should see your faces
(He was chaos, he was revelry)
(He was chaos, he was revelry)"

Clara Bow,"[Verse 1]
""You look like Clara Bow
In this light, remarkable
All your life, did you know
You'd be picked like a rose?""
[Pre-Chorus]
""I'm not trying to exaggerate
But I think I might die if it happened
Die if it happened to me
No one in my small town
Thought I'd see the lights of Manhattan""
[Chorus]
""This town is fake, but you're the rea
l 
thing
Breath of fresh air through smoke rings
Take the glory, give everything
Promise to be dazzling""
[Verse 2]
""You look like Stevie Nicks
In '75, the hair and lips
Crowd goes wild at her fingertips
Half moonshine, a full еclipse""
[Pre-Chorus]
""I'm not trying to exaggeratе
But I think I might die if I made it, die if I made it
No one in my small town thought I'd meet these suits in L.A
.
They all wanna say...""
[Chorus]
""This town is fake, but you're the real thing
Breath of fresh air through smoke rings
Take the glory, give everything
Promise to be dazzling
The crown is stained, but you're the real queen
Flesh and blood amongst war machines
You're the new god we're worshipping
Promise to be dazzling""
[Bridge]
Beauty is a beast that roars down on all fours
Demanding more
Only when your girlish glow flickers just so
Do they let you know
It's hell on earth to be heavenly
Them's the breaks, they don't come gently
[Outro]
""You look like Taylor Swift
In this light, we're lovin' it
You've got edge, she never did
The future's bright, dazzling"""
Clean (Taylor's Version),"[Verse 1]
The drought was the very worst, ah-ah, ah-ah
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth, ah-ah, ah-ah
You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore
[Pre-Chorus]
Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm
[Chorus]
The rain came pouring down
When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe
And by mornin', gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean
[Verse 2]
There was nothin' left to do, ah-ah, ah-ah
When the butterflies turnеd to dust that covered my whole room
So I punchеd a hole in the roof, ah-ah, ah-ah
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
[Pre-Chorus]
The water filled my lungs
I screamed so loud, but no one heard a thing
[Chorus]
The rain came pourin' down
When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe
And by mornin', gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean
[Post-Chorus]
I think I am finally clean
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Said I think I am finally clean
Ah-ah-ah
[Bridge]
Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean, don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it
[Break]
The drought was the very worst, ah-ah, ah-ah
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
[Chorus]
The rain came pourin' down
When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe
And by mornin', gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean
The rain came pourin' down
When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe
And by mornin', gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

Finally clean
Think I'm finally clean
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Think I'm finally clean"
Come Back...Be Here (Taylor's Version),
Cornelia Street,"[Verse 1]
We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
""I rent a place on Cornelia Street""
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home
[Chorus]
And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
[Verse 2]
Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone
[Pre-Chorus]
But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I
[Chorus]
I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name (City screams your name)
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
[Bridge]
You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago, we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion, listen
[Chorus]
I hope I never lose you
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
Oh, never again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name (City screams your name)
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
[Post-Chorus]
I don't wanna lose you (Hope it never ends)
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I don't wanna lose you (Yeah)

""I rent a place on Cornelia Street""

Cruel Summer,"[Intro]
(
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
)
[Verse 1]
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (
Oh yeah, you're right, I want it
)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (
Oh yeah, you're right, I want it
)
[Pre-Chorus]
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more
[Chorus]
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you
[Verse 2]
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (
Oh yeah, you're right, I want it
)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (
Oh yeah, you're right, I want it
)
[Pre-Chorus]
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh
[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you
[Bridge]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""
He looks up, grinnin' like a devil
[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you
[Outro]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true

Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Daylight,"[Verse 1]
My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth but never goodbye
[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleepin' so long in a twenty-year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight
[Verse 2]
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearin' the air, I breathed in the smoke
[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now
[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleepin' so long in a twenty-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (Daylight), I only see daylight (Daylight)
[Post-Chorus]
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
[Bridge]
And I can still see it all (In my mind)
All of you, all of me (Intertwined)
I once believed love would be (Black and white)
But it's golden (Golden)
And I can still see it all (In my head)
Back and forth from New York (Sneakin' in your bed)
I once believed love would be (Burnin' red)
But it's golden
Like daylight, like daylight
Like daylight, daylight
[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
And I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleepin' so long in a twenty-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (I see daylight), I only see daylight (Ah)
[Post-Chorus]
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (Ah)
(And I can still see it all)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(And I can still see it all, back and forth from New York)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(I once believed love would be burning red)
[Outro]
Like daylight
It's golden like daylight
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
Just let it go, let it go
[Spoken Outro]
I wanna be defined by the things that I love
Not the things I hate
Not the things I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of
Or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night
I, I just think that
You are what you love"
Dear John (Taylor's Version),"[Verse 1]
Long were the nights
When my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Prayin' the floor won't fall through again
And my mother accused me of losin' my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you change the rules every day
Wonderin' which version of you
I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped pickin' up
And this song is to let you know why
[Chorus]
Dear John,
 I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I shoulda known
[Verse 2]
Well, maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said
""Run as fast as you can""
[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young to be played by
Your dark, twisted games when I loved you so?
I shoulda known
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
You are an expert at ""Sorry"" and keepin' lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you run dry have tired, lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town
Oh
[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You shoulda known
[Outro]
You shoulda known
Don't you think I was too young?
You shoulda known"
Dear Reader,"[Verse 1]
Dear reader,
 if it feels like a trap
You're already in one
Dear reader, get out your map
Pick somewhere and just run
Dear reader, burn all the files
Desert all your past lives
And if you don't recognize yourself
That means you did it right
[Chorus]
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart (You should find another)
[Verse 2]
Dear reader, bend when you can
Snap when you have to
Dear reader, you don't have to answer
Just 'cause they asked you
(You should find another)
Dear reader, the greatest of luxuries is your secrets
Dear reader, when you aim at the devil
Make sure you don't miss
[Chorus]
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart
[Bridge]
So I wander through these nights
I prefer hiding in plain sight
My fourth drink in my hand
These desperate prayers of a cursed man
Spilling out to you for free
But darling, darling, please
You wouldn't take my word for it if you knew who was talking
If you knew where I was walking
To a house, not a home, all alone 'cause nobody's there
Where I pace in my pen and my friends found friends who care
No one sees when you lose when you're playing solitaire
[Outro]
You should find another guiding light, guiding light
But I shine so bright
You should find another guiding light, guiding light
But I shine so bright
You should find another, you should find another (Guiding light)
Find another, you should find another
You should find another"
Death By A Thousand Cuts,"[Intro]
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
[Chorus]
Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
’Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
’Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts
[Verse]
I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, ""I don't know""
And what once was ours is no one's now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love, one for the ages
But if the story’s over, why am I still writing pages?
[Chorus]
’Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
’Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can’t pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts
[Bridge]
My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
Gave you too much, but it wasn't enough
But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts
[Chorus]
I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
No, it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts (You didn't touch)
[Post-Chorus]
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
My body, my love, my trust (It's death by a thousand cuts)
But it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no
[Outro]
I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, ""I don't know"""
Down Bad,"[Verse 1]
Did you really beam me up
In a cloud of sparkling dust
Just to do experiments on?
Tell me I was the chosen one
Showed me that this world is bigger than us
Then sent me back where I came from
[Pre-Chorus]
For a moment, I knew cosmic love
[Chorus]
Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym
Everything comes out teenage petulance
""Fuck it if I can't have him""
""I might just die, it would make no difference""
Down bad, wakin' up in blood
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay
[Post-Chorus]
Down bad
Fuck it if I can't have him
Down bad
Fuck it if I can't have him
[Verse 2]
Did you take all my old clothes
Just to leave me here, naked and alone
In a field in my same old town
That somehow seems so hollow now?
They'll say I'm nuts if I talk about
The existence of you
[Pre-Chorus]
For a moment, I was heavenstruck
[Chorus]
Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym (Cryin' at the gym)
Everything comes out teenage petulance
""Fuck it if I can't have him"" (Fuck it if I can't have him)
""I might just die, it would make no difference""
Down bad, wakin' up in blood (Wakin' up in blood)
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay
[Post-Chorus]
Down bad (Like I lost my twin)
Fuck it if I can't have him (Down bad)
Down bad (Wavin' at the ship)
Fuck it if I can't have him
[Bridge]
I loved your hostile takeovers
Encounters closer and closer
All your indecent exposures
How dare you say that it's—
I'll build you a fort on some planet
Where they can all understand it
How dare you think it's romantic
Leaving me safe and stranded
'Cause fuck it, I was in love
So fuck you if I can't have us
'Cause fuck it, I was in love
[Chorus]
Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym (Cryin' at the gym)
Everything comes out teenage petulance
""Fuck it if I can't have him"" (Can't have him)
""I might just die, it would make no difference""
Down bad, wakin' up in blood (Wakin' up in blood)
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay
[Post-Chorus]
Down bad (Like I lost my twin)
Fuck it if I can't have him (I'm down bad)
Down bad (Wavin' at the ship)
Fuck it if I can't have him
[Outro]
Like I lost my twin
Fuck it if I can't have him
Down bad (Wavin' at the ship)
Fuck it if I can't have him"
Electric Touch (feat. Fall Out Boy) (Taylor’s Version) (From The Vault),
Enchanted (Taylor's Version),"[Verse 1]
There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
[Verse 2]
Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""
Across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you
[Chorus]
This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spеnd forever wonderin' if you knеw
I was enchanted to meet you
[Verse 3]
The lingering question kept me up
2 a.m., who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now, I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
""Hey, it was enchanting to meet you""
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you
[Chorus]
This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
[Bridge]
This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waitin' on you
Please, don't be in love with someone else (Ooh)
Please, don't have somebody waitin' on you (Oh-oh)
[Chorus]
This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
This night is flawless (Please, don't be in love with someone else)
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck (Please, don't have somebody waitin' on you)
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever (Please, don't be in love with someone else)
Wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
[Outro]
Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waitin' on you"
Everything Has Changed (feat. Ed Sheeran) (Taylor’s Version),
False God,"[Verse 1]
We were crazy to think
Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said I'd die for you?
We were stupid to jump
In the ocean separating us
Remember how I’d fly to you?
[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't talk to you when you're like this
Staring out the window like I’m not your favorite town
I'm New York City
I still do it for you, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith
[Chorus]
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We’d still worship this love
We’d still worship this love
[Verse 2]
I know heaven's a thing
I go there when you touch me, honey
Hell is when I fight with you
But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and we’re begging for forgiveness
Got the wine for you
[Pre-Chorus]
And you can't talk to me when I'm like this
Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you
You're the West Village
You still do it for me, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you’re led by blind faith, blind faith
[Chorus]
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love, ah
[Outro]
Still worship this love
Even if it's a false god
Even if it's a false god
Still worship this love"
Fearless,"[Verse 1]
There's somethin' 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
You walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parkin' lot, yeah
Oh, yeah
[Verse 2]
We're driving down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly makin' me want you
[Chorus]
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why, but with you, I'd dance
In a storm, in my best dress, fearless
[Verse 3]
So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road
In this one-horse town,
 I wanna stay right here
In this passenger seat, you put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it
[Chorus]
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why, but with you, I'd dance
In a storm, in my best dress, fearless
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh
[Bridge]
Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really somethin'
It's fearless
Oh, yeah
[Chorus]
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why, but with you, I'd dance
In a storm, in my best dress, fearless
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why, but with you, I'd dance
In a storm, in my best dress, fearless

Oh-oh
Oh-oh, yeah"

Foolish One (Taylor’s Version) (From The Vault),"[Verse 1]
My cards are on the table, yours are in your hand
Chances are, tonight, you've already got plans
And chances are I will talk myself to sleep again
You give me just enough attention to keep my hopes too high
Wishful thoughts forget to mention when something's really not right
And I will block out these voices of reason in my head
[Pre-Chorus]
And the voices say, ""You are not the exception
You will never learn your lesson""
[Chorus]
Foolish one
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will take the long way, you will take the long way down
[Verse 2]
You know how to keep me waitin'
I know how to act like I'm fine
Don't know what to call this situation
But I know I can't call you mine
And it's delicate, but I will do my best to seem bulletproof
'Cause when my head is on your shoulder
It starts thinkin' you'll come around
And maybe, someday, when we're older
This is something we'll laugh about
Over coffee every mornin' while you're watching the news
[Pre-Chorus]
But then the voices say, ""You are not the exception
You will never learn your lesson""
[Chorus]
Foolish one
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will take the long way, you will take the long way down
Foolish one
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out
[Bridge]
Now I'm slidin' down the wall with my head in my hands
Sayin', ""How could I not see the signs?""
Oh, you haven't written me or called
But goodbye screamin' in the silence
And the voices in my head are tellin' me why
'Cause you got her on your arm and me in the wings
I'll get your longing glances, but she'll get your ring
And you will say you had the best of intentions
And maybe I will finally learn my lesson
[Chorus]
Foolish one
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will take the long way, you will take the long way down
Foolish one
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out, oh-oh, oh, oh
[Outro]
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, oh
La-la-la-la-la
Ain't never gonna come
Ooh, you will learn the hard way now
Foolish one
Sittin' 'round waiting for confessions of love
They ain't never gonna come
And thinkin' he's the one, you should've been walkin' out
Foolish one
The day is gonna come for your confessions of love
When all is said and done, he just wasn't the one
No, he just wasn't the one"
Forever Winter (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault),"[Verse 1]
He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days
He says, ""Why fall in love, just so you can watch it go away?""
He spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be
He spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity
[Pre-Chorus]
I call, just checkin' up on him
He's up, 3AM, pacin'
He says, ""
It's not just a phase I'm in
""
My voice comes out beggin'
[Chorus]
All this time, I didn't know
You were breakin' down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren't around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go
[Verse 2]
He seems fine most of the time, forcing smiles and never minds
His laugh is a symphony, when the lights go out, it's hard to breathe
I pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head
Live my life scared to death he'll decide to leave instead
[Pre-Chorus]
I call, just checkin' up on him
He's up, 5AM, wasted
Long gone, not even listening
My voice comes out screamin'
[Chorus]
All this time, I didn't know
You were breakin' down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren't around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go
[Bridge]
If I was standing there in your apartment
I'd take that bomb in your head and disarm it
I'd say, ""I love you even at your darkest and
Please, don't go""
[Chorus]
I didn't know
You were breakin' down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren't around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go

(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'll be your summer sun forever

All this time, I didn't know

I'd be in pieces on the floor
Forever winter if you go

He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days
I say, ""Believe in one thing, I won't go away"""
Fortnight (feat. Post Malone),
Fresh Out The Slammer,"[Intro]
Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin' back home to you
Fresh out the slammer, I know who my first call will be to
(Fresh out the slammer, oh)
[Verse 1]
Another summer takin' cover, rolling thunder
He don't understand me
Splintered back in winter
, 
silent dinners, bitter
He was with her in dreams
[Pre-Chorus]
Gray and blue and fights and tunnels
Handcuffed to the spell I was under
For just one hour of sunshine
Years of labor, locks, and ceilings
In the shade of how he was feeling
But it's gonna be alright, I did my time
[Chorus]
Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin' back home to you
Frеsh out the slammer, I know who my first call will be to
(Frеsh out the slammer, oh)
[Verse 2]
Camera flashes, welcome bashes, get the matches
Toss the ashes off the ledge
As I said in my letters, now that I know better
I will never lose my baby again
[Pre-Chorus]
My friends tried, but I wouldn't hear it
Watch me daily disappearing
For just one glimpse of his smile
All those nights, he kept me goin'
Swirled you into all of my poems
Now we're at the starting line, I did my time
[Chorus]
Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin'
[Bridge]
To the house where you still wait up and that porch light gleams (Gleams)
To the one who says I'm the girl of his American dreams
And no matter what I've done, it wouldn't matter anyway
Ain't no way I'm gonna screw up now that I know what's at stake here
At the park where we used to sit on children's swings
Wearing imaginary rings
[Outro]
But it's gonna be alright, I did my time"
Girl At Home (Taylor's Version),"[Intro]
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don’t look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
[Verse 1]
I don't even know her
But I feel a responsibility
To do what's upstanding and right
It’s kinda like a code, yeah
And you've been getting closer and closer
And crossing so many lines
[Pre-Chorus]
And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
But, honey, I am no one's exception
This, I have previously learned
[Chorus]
So don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, еverybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got mе alone, and I say
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
[Verse 2]
I just wanna make sure
You understand perfectly
You're the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up
You chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have
[Pre-Chorus]
And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
And, yeah, I might go with it
If I hadn’t once been just like her

So don’t look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home

Don't look at me, you got a girl at home

Call a cab, lose my number
You're about to lose your girl
Call a cab, lose my number
Let's consider this lesson learned

Don’t look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Wanna see you pick up your phone
And tell her you're coming home
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home

Glitch,"[Verse 1]
We were supposed to be just friends
You don't live in my part of town, but maybe I'll see you out some weekend
Depending on what kind of mood and situationship I'm in
And what's in my system
[Chorus]
I think there's been a glitch, oh, yeah
Five seconds later, I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, oh, yeah
And I'm not even sorry, nights are so starry
Blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit
I think there's been a glitch, oh, yeah
[Verse 2]
I was supposed to sweat you out
In search of glorious happenings of happenstance on someone else's playground
But it's been two-thousand one-hundred ninety days of our love blackout
(Our love is blacking out)
The system's breaking down
(The system's breaking down)

I think there's been a glitch, oh, yeah
Five seconds later, I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, oh, yeah
And I'm not even sorry, nights are so starry
Blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit
I think there's been a glitch

A brief interruption, a slight malfunction
I'd go back to wanting dudes who give nothing
I thought we had no chance
And that's romance, let's dance
[Chorus]
Glitch, oh, yeah
Five seconds later, I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, oh, yeah
And I'm not even sorry, nights are so starry
Blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit (It must be counterfeit)

Guilty as Sin?,"[Verse 1]
Drownin' in the Blue Nile
He sent me ""Downtown Lights""
I hadn't heard it in a while
My boredom's bone-deep
This cage was once just fine
Am I allowed to cry?
I dream of crackin' locks
Throwin' my life to the wolves
 or 
the ocean rocks
Crashin' into him tonight, he's a paradox
I'm seeing visions
Am I bad or mad or wise?
[Chorus]
What if he's 
written
 
""mine""
 on my 
upper thigh
 
only in my mind?
One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
Oh, what a way to die
I keep recalling things we never did
Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
Without ever touchin' his skin
How can I be guilty as sin?
[Verse 2]
I keep these longings lockеd
In lowercase, inside a vault
Somеone told me, ""There's no such thing as bad thoughts
Only your actions talk""
These fatal fantasies
Giving way to labored breath, takin' all of me
We've already done it in my head
If it's make-believe
Why does it feel like a vow we'll both uphold somehow?
[Chorus]
What if he's written ""mine"" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
Oh, what a way to die
My bed sheets are ablaze
I've screamed his name
Buildin' up like waves crashin' over my grave
Without ever touchin' his skin
How can I be guilty as sin?
[Bridge]
What if I roll the stone away?
They're gonna crucify me anyway
What if the way you hold me is actually what's holy?
If long-suffering propriety is what they want from me
They don't know how you've haunted me so stunningly
I choose you and me religiously
[Chorus]
What if he's written ""mine"" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
Oh, what a way to die
I keep recalling things we never did
Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
Without ever touchin' his skin
How can I be guilty as sin?
[Outro]
He sent me ""Downtown Lights""
I hadn't heard it in a while
Am I allowed to cry?"
Haunted (Taylor's Version),"[Verse 1]
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all so quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold
[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted
[Verse 2]
Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time, I'm wishing he was you instead
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding onto nothing
[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted
[Bridge]
I know, I know
I just know
You're not gone
You can't be gone, no
[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong (Terribly wrong)
Won't finish what you started
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
I can't go back, I'm haunted
[Outro]
Oh
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break
Never thought I'd see it"
High Infidelity,"[Verse 1]
Lock broken, slur spoken
Wound open, game token
I didn't know you were keeping count
Rain soaking, blind hoping
You said I was freeloading
I didn't know you were keeping count
[Chorus]
High infidelity
Put on your records and regret me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around, dancing around it
High infidelity
Put on your headphones and burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives
I was dancing around, dancing around it
[Refrain]
Do you really wanna know where I was April 29th?
Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes?
[Verse 2]
Storm coming, good husband
Bad omen
Dragged my feet right down the aisle
At the house lonely, good money
I'd pay if you'd just know me
Seemed like the right thing at the time
[Refrain]
You know there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love
The slowest way is never loving them enough
Do you really wanna know where I was April 29th?
Do I really have to tell you how he brought me back to life?
[Chorus]
High infidelity
Put on your records and regret me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around, dancing around it
High infidelity
Put on your headphones and burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives
I was dancing around, dancing around it
[Refrain]
Do you really want to know where I was April 29th?
Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes?
You know there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love
The slowest way is never loving them enough
[Chorus]
High infidelity
Put on your records and regret meeting me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around, dancing around it
High infidelity
Put on your headphones and burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives
I was dancing around, dancing around it
[Non-Lyrical Break]
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love
And it's never enough, it's never enough
[Outro]
Lock broken, slur spoken
Wound open, game token
I didn't know you were keeping count
Rain soaking, blind hoping
You said I was freeloading
I didn't know you were keeping count
But, oh, you were keeping count"
Holy Ground (Taylor's Version),"[Verse 1]
I was reminiscing just the other day
While havin' coffee all alone and, Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feelin' on New York time
Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Yeah, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day
[Chorus]
And darlin', it was good
Never lookin' down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground
[Verse 2]
Spinnin' like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big, wide city all to ourselves
Wе block the noise with the sound of, ""I need you""
And for thе first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But, sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd
[Chorus]
'Cause, darlin', it was good (Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy)
Never lookin' down (Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy)
And right there where we stood (Ooh-ayy)
Was holy ground
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, oh-woah
Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, oh-woah
[Bridge]
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancin' with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancin' with you
[Chorus]
It was good
I'm never lookin' down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, oh-woah
Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, oh-woah
[Outro]
Tonight, I'm gonna dance (Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy)
For all that we've been through (Ooh-ayy, oh-woah)
But I don't wanna dance (Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy)
If I'm not dancin' with you (Ooh-ayy, oh-woah)
Tonight, I'm gonna dance (Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy)
Like you were in this room (Ooh-ayy, oh-woah)
But I don't wanna dance (Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy)
If I'm not dancin' with you"
How You Get The Girl (Taylor's Version),"[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
[Verse 1]
Stand there like a ghost, shakin' from the rain, rain
She'll open up the door and say, ""Are you insane-ane?""
Say, ""It's been a long six months""
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want, want
[Pre-Chorus]
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl
And then you say
[Chorus]
""I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait forever and ever""
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl, oh
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl
[Verse 2]
Remind her how it used to be, be, yeah, yеah
Of pictures in frames, of kisses on cheeks, cheeks
Tеll her how you must have lost your mind, ooh
When you left her all alone and never told her why, why
[Pre-Chorus]
And that's how it works
That's how you lost the girl
And now you say

I would wait forever and ever (Ever and ever)
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together (Put it back together)

Remind me how it used to be
Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks
And say you want me, yeah, yeah, 'cause

""I want you for worse or for better (Worse or for better)
I would wait forever and ever (Ever and ever)
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I want you forever and ever (I want you forever and ever)""
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl ('Cause it's how it works)

I Almost Do (Taylor's Version),"[Verse 1]
I bet, this time of night, you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long, hard week
I bet you're sittin' in your chair by the window lookin' out at the city
And I bet sometimes you wonder 'bout me
[Chorus]
And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don't, I almost do
I almost do
[Verse 2]
I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
'Cause each time you reach out, there's no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you
That I can't say hello to you and risk another goodbye
[Chorus]
And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don't, I almost do
I almost do
[Post-Chorus]
(Ooh)
[Bridge]
Oh, we made quite a mess, babe
It's probably better off this way
And I confess, babe
In my dreams, you're touchin' my face
And asking me if I'd wanna try again with you
And I almost do
[Chorus]
And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don't, I almost do
I almost do

(Ooh)

I bet, this time of night, you’re still up
I bet you're tired from a long, hard week
I bet you're sittin' in your chair by the window lookin' out at the city
And I hope sometimes you wonder 'bout me"
I Bet You Think About Me (feat. Chris Stapleton) (Taylor’s Version) (From The Vault),
I Can Do It With a Broken Heart,"[Verse 1]
I can read your mind
""She's having the time of her life""
There in her glittering prime
The lights refract sequin stars off her silhouette every night
I can show you lies
(
One, two, three, four
)
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm a real tough kid
I can handle my shit
They said, ""Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it"" and I did
Lights, camera, bitch, smile
Even when you wanna die
He said he'd love me all his life
But that life was too short
Breaking down, I hit the floor
All the piеces of me shatterеd as the crowd was chanting
, 
""More""
I was grinnin' like I'm winnin'
I was hittin' my marks
'Cause I can do it with a broken heart
(
One, two, three, four
)
[Chorus]
I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day
I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me like the plague
I cry a lot, but I am so productive, it's an art
You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart
[Verse 2]
I can hold my breath
I've been doin' it since he left
I keep finding his things in drawers
Crucial evidence I didn't imagine the whole thing
I'm sure I can pass this test
(
One, two, three, four
)
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm a real tough kid
I can handle my shit
They said, ""Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it"" and I did
Lights, camera, bitch, smile
In stilettos for miles
He said he'd love me for all time
But that time was quite short
Breaking down, I hit the floor
All the pieces of me shattered as the crowd was chanting, ""More""
I was grinnin' like I'm winnin'
I was hittin' my marks
'Cause I can do it with a broken heart
(
One, two, three, four
)
[Chorus]
I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day
I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me (He avoids me), like the plague
I cry a lot, but I am so productive, it's an art
You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart
[Outro]
You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart
You know you're good
And I'm good
'Cause I'm miserable (Haha)
And nobody even knows
Ah, try and come for my job"
I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can),"[Verse 1]
The smoke cloud billows out his mouth
Like a freight train through a small town
The jokes that he told across the bar
Were revolting and far too loud
[Chorus]
They shake their heads sayin', ""God, help her""
When I tell 'em he's my man
But your good Lord doesn't need to lift a finger
I can fix him, no, really, I can
And only I can
[Verse 2]
The dopamine races through his brain
On a six-lane Texas highway
His hand so calloused from his pistol
Softly traces hearts on my face
And I could see it from a mile away
A perfect case for my certain skill set
He had a halo of the highest gradе
He just hadn't met me yеt
[Chorus]
They shake their heads sayin', ""God, help her""
When I tell 'em he's my man
But your good Lord doesn't need to lift a finger
I can fix him, no, really, I can
And only I can
[Bridge]
Good boy, that's right, come close
I'll show you Heaven if you'll be an angel, all night
Trust me, I can handle me a dangerous man
No, really, I can
[Chorus]
They shook their heads sayin', ""God, help her""
When I told 'em he's my man (I told 'em he's my man)
But your good Lord didn't need to lift a finger
I can fix him, no, really, I can (No, really, I can)
Woah, maybe I can't"
I Can See You (Taylor’s Version) (From The Vault),"[Intro]
I-I-I-I
[Verse 1]
You brush past me in the hallway
And you don't think I, I, I can see ya, do ya?
I’ve been watchin' you for ages
And I spend my time tryin' not to feel it
[Pre-Chorus]
But what would you do if I went to touch you now?
What would you do if they never found us out?
What would you do if we never made a sound?
[Chorus]
’Cause I can see you waitin' down the hall from me
And I could see you up against the wall with me
And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew
That I can see you
[Post-Chorus]
I-I-I-I
[Verse 2]
And we kept everything professional
But something's changed, it's somethin' I, I like
They keep watchful eyes on us
So it's best that we move fast and keep quiet
You won't believe half the things I see inside my head
Wait 'til you see half the things that haven’t happened yet
[Pre-Chorus]
But what would you do if I went to touch you now?
What would you do if they never found us out?
What would you do if we never made a sound?
[Chorus]
’Cause I can see you waitin' down the hall from me
And I could see you up against the wall with me
And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew, oh, oh, oh
That I could see you throw your jacket on the floor
I could see you make me want you even more
What would you do? Baby, if you only knew
That I can see you
[Post-Chorus]
I-I-I-I
[Bridge]
I can see you in your suit and your necktie
Passed me a note sayin’, ""Meet me tonight""
Then we kiss and you know I won't ever tell, yeah
And I could see you being my addiction
You can see me as a secret mission
Hide away and I will start behaving myself
[Pre-Chorus]
I-I-I-I
Oh-oh, oh, oh
[Chorus]
I can see you waitin' down the hall from me
And I could see you up against the wall with me
And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew, oh
That I could see you throw your jacket on the floor
I could see you make me want you even more
What would you do? Baby, if you only knew
That I can see you, oh, I can see you

Oh, I see you, I see you, baby
I see you

I Forgot That You Existed,"[Verse 1]
How many days did I spend thinking
'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?
Lived in the shade you were throwing
'Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone
And I couldn't get away from ya
In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah
Your name on my lips, tongue-tied
Free rent, living in my mind
[Pre-Chorus]
But then something happened one magical night
[Chorus]
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you
[Verse 2]
Got out some popcorn
As soon as my rep started going down, down, down
Laughed on the school yard
As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground
And I would've stuck around for ya
Would've fought the whole town, so yeah
Would've been right there, front row
Even if nobody came to your show
[Pre-Chorus]
But you showed who you are, then one magical night
[Chorus]
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you
[Bridge]
Sent me a clear message
Taught me some hard lessons
I just forget what they were
It's all just a blur
[Chorus]
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
I did, I did, I did
It isn't hate, it's just indifference
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
So, yeah"
I Knew You Were Trouble (Taylor's Version),"[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me-e-e-e-e
I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me-e-e-e-e-e

And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning-ing-ing-ing-ing
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see-e-e-e-e-e

He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, hey

You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign
Somethin' happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circlin', dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out

'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes and guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run

Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places

Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it

Go there every night

His hands around a cold glass
Make me wanna know that

No one understands

I wish you would
[Outro]
You always knew how to push my buttons (I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I)
You give me everything and nothin' (I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I)
This mad, mad love makes you come runnin' (I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I)
To stand back where you stood (I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I)
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
(I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I)
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would, I wish you would, I wish you would)
(I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I)
I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I
I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I
I wish you would"
Innocent (Taylor's Version),"[Verse 1]
I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your war path
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind tryin' to get it back
[Pre-Chorus]
Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you?
[Chorus]
It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent
[Verse 2]
Did some things you can't speak of
But at night, you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then
[Pre-Chorus]
Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
When everything out of reach
Someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you?
[Chorus]
It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
Thirty-two and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
[Bridge]
Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up, too, ooh
Minds change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to be brand new
Oh, oh
[Chorus]
It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
Thirty-two and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent
[Outro]
Lost your balance on a tightrope, oh
It's never too late to get it back"
Is It Over Now? (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault),"[Intro]
(
Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?
)
[Verse 1]
Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh)
With the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh)
I slept all alone (Uh-huh)
You still wouldn't go
[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby
[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
""Come here,"" I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passеd out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?
[Post-Chorus]
(
Is it? Is it? Is it?
)
[Verse 2]
Whеn you lost control (Uh-huh)
Red blood, white snow (Uh-huh)
Blue dress on a boat (Uh-huh)
Your new girl is my clone
[Bridge]
And did you think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no
[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later
 (Oh)
If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)
You search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby
[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
""Come here,"" I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passed out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?
[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh

Is it? Is it? Is it?

Uh-huh

Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin' (Runnin')
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later (Oh)

And say the one thing (Oh, Lord)
I've been wanting (Oh, Lord)

It’s Nice To Have A Friend,"[Intro]
Ooh
Ooh
[Verse 1]
School bell rings, walk me home
Sidewalk chalk covered in snow
Lost my gloves, you give me one
""Wanna hang out?"" Yeah, sounds like fun
Video games, you pass me a note
Sleeping in tents
[Chorus]
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
[Verse 2]
Light pink sky, up on the roof
Sun sinks down, no curfew
Twenty questions, we tell the truth
You've been stressed out lately, yeah, me too
Something gave you the nerve
To touch my hand
[Chorus]
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
[Instrumental Bridge]

Church bells ring, carry me home
Rice on the ground looks like snow
Call my bluff, call you ""Babe""
Have my back, yeah, every day
Feels like home, stay in bed
The whole weekend

It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)

Karma,"[Verse 1]
You're talking shit for the hell of it
Addicted to betrayal, but you're relevant
You're terrified to look down
'Cause if you dare, you'll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
It's coming back around
[Pre-Chorus]
And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean
[Chorus]
'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that
[Verse 2]
Spiderboy, king of thieves
Weave your little webs of opacity
My pennies made your crown
Trick me once, trick me twice
Don't you know that cash ain't the only price?
It's coming back around
[Pre-Chorus]
And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean
[Chorus]
'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend

Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Ask me what I learned from all those years
Ask me what I earned from all those tears
Ask me why so many fade, but I'm still here
(I'm still here, I'm still here)
[Breakdown]
'Cause karma is the thunder
Rattling your ground
Karma's on your scent like a bounty hunter
Karma's gonna track you down
Step by step, from town to town
Sweet like justice, karma is a queen
Karma takes all my friends to the summit
Karma is the guy on the screen
Coming straight home to me
[Chorus]
'Cause karma is my boyfriend (Karma is my boyfriend)
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend (Weekend)

Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat

Labyrinth,"[Verse 1]
""It only hurts this much right now""
Was what I was thinkin' the whole time
Breathe in, breathe through, breathe deep, breathe out
I'll be gettin' over you my whole life
[Pre-Chorus]
You know how scared I am of elevators
Never trust it if it rises fast
It can't last
[Chorus]
Uh-oh, I'm fallin' in love
Oh no, I'm fallin' in love again
Oh, I'm fallin' in love
I thought the plane was goin' down
How'd you turn it right around?
[Verse 2]
It only feels this raw right now
Lost in the labyrinth of my mind
Break up, break free, break through, break down
You would break your back to make me break a smile
[Pre-Chorus]
You know how much I hate
That everybody just expects me to bounce back
Just like that

Uh-oh, I'm fallin' in love
Oh no, I'm fallin' in love again

Last Kiss (Taylor's Version),"[Verse 1]
I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered for just us to know
You told me you loved me, so why did you go away?
Away
I do recall now, the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement, I ran off the plane
That July ninth, the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms
[Pre-Chorus]
But now I'll go
Sit on the floor wearin' your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be somethin' you miss
[Chorus]
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips
[Verse 2]
I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showin' off again
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancin', but for you, I did
Because I love your handshake meetin' my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions
[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll go
Sit on the floor wearin' your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be somethin' you miss
[Chorus]
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips, mmm
[Bridge]
So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are
[Verse 3]
And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you you wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in the weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind
[Pre-Chorus]
So I'll go
Sit on the floor wearin' your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be somethin' you miss
[Chorus]
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips
[Outro]
Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips
Just like our last"

Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh, you don't ever say too much
And you don't really read into

You handle it beautifully (Yeah, oh, yeah)

They're bringing up my history (Yeah, oh, yeah)
But you weren't even listening (Yeah, oh, yeah)

Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk

London Boy,"[Intro: Idris Elba & 
James Corden

We can go drivin' in, on my scooter
Uh, you know, just 'round London (
Oh, I'd—
)
[Verse 1]
I love my hometown as much as Motown, I love SoCal
And you know I love Springsteen, faded blue jeans, Tennessee whiskey
But somethin' happened, I heard him laughin'
I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent
[Pre-Chorus]
They say, ""Home is where the heart is""
But that's not where mine lives
[Chorus]
You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walkin' Camden Market in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you (Ooh)
[Verse 2]
And now I love high tea, stories from Uni' and the West End
You can find me in the pub, we are watchin' rugby with his school friends
Show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride
Babes, don't threaten me with a good time
[Pre-Chorus]
They say, ""Home is where the heart is""
But, God, I love the English
[Chorus]
You know I love a London boy
I enjoy nights in Brixton, Shoreditch in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you
[Bridge]
So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you
Wanna be with you
Stick with me, I'm your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney on the Heath
Just wanna be with you (Wanna be with you)
Wanna be with you, oh, woah
[Chorus]
You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walkin' Soho, drinkin' in the afternoon (Yeah)
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you (You)
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true (Yeah)
You know I love a London boy (Oh)
Boy (Oh), I fancy you (I fancy you; ooh)
[Outro]
So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you (Ooh)
I, oh, I, I fancy you, oh, woah-ah-ah (Ooh)
Stick with me, I'm your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney on the Heath
Just wanna be with you (Ooh), wanna be with you
I fancy you (Yeah), I fancy you, ah-ah (Ooh)"
Long Live (Taylor's Version),"[Verse 1]
I said, ""Remember this moment""
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age
[Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashеd through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was scrеaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered
[Verse 2]
I said, ""Remember this feeling""
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishin' for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""This is absurd""
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world
[Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, ""Long live that look on your face""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered
[Bridge]
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
Will you take a moment? Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please, tell 'em my name
Tell 'em how the crowds went wild
Tell 'em how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you
[Chorus]
Long, long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Singing, ""Long live all the mountains we moved""
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered"
Love Story,"[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know
[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said
[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said
[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh
[Bridge]
But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town and I said
[Chorus]
""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'""
[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you"
Lover,"[Verse 1]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?
[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover
[Verse 2]
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all
[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover
[Bridge]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover
[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover"
ME! (feat. Brendon Urie of Panic! At The Disco),
Maroon,"[Verse 1]
When the morning came
We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf
'Cause we lost track of time again
Laughing with my feet in your lap
Like you were my closest friend
""How'd we end up on the floor, anyway?"" you say
""Your roommate's cheap-ass screw-top rosé, that's how""
I see you every day now
[Chorus]
And I chose you
The one I was dancing with
In New York, no shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was
The mark thеy saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew bеtween telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon
[Verse 2]
When the silence came
We were shaking, blind and hazy
How the hell did we lose sight of us again?
Sobbing with your head in your hands
Ain't that the way shit always ends?
You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway
Carnations you had thought were roses, that's us
I feel you, no matter what
The rubies that I gave up
[Chorus]
And I lost you
The one I was dancing with
In New York, no shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was (Maroon)
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was (Maroon)
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon
[Bridge]
And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fucking legacy, legacy (It was maroon)
And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fucking legacy to leave
[Chorus]
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was maroon
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon
[Outro]
It was maroon
It was maroon"
Mastermind,"[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, the planets and the fates
And all the stars aligned
You and I ended up in the same room
At the same time
[Pre-Chorus]
And the touch of a hand lit the fuse
Of a chain reaction of countermoves
To assess the equation of you
Checkmate, I couldn't lose
[Chorus]
What if I told you none of it was accidental?
And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork, and then
Just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all by dеsign
'Cause I'm a mastermind
[Verse 2]
You see, all the wisеst women
Had to do it this way
'Cause we were born to be the pawn
In every lover's game
[Pre-Chorus]
If you fail to plan, you plan to fail
Strategy sets the scene for the tale
I'm the wind in our free-flowing sails
And the liquor in our cocktails
[Chorus]
What if I told you none of it was accidental?
And the first night that you saw me
I knew I wanted your body
I laid the groundwork, and then
Just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all my design
'Cause I'm a mastermind
[Bridge]
No one wanted to play with me as a little kid
So I've been scheming like a criminal ever since
To make them love me and make it seem effortless
This is the first time I've felt the need to confess
And I swear
I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian
'Cause I care
[Chorus]
So I told you none of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork, and then
Saw a wide smirk on your face
You knew the entire time
You knew that I'm a mastermind
And now you're mine
Yeah, all you did was smile
'Cause I'm a mastermind"
Mean (Taylor's Version),"[Verse 1]
You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feelin' like a nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, pickin' on the weaker man
[Pre-Chorus]
Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know
[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be livin' in a big ole city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
[Verse 2]
You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again
[Pre-Chorus]
I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know
[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be livin' in a big ole city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
[Bridge]
And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big, loud opinion, but nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same ole bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean
[Buildup]
All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic
And alone in life, and mean
And mean, and mean, and mean
[Chorus]
But someday, I'll be livin' in a big ole city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
Someday, I'll be livin' in a big ole city
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?"
Message In A Bottle (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault),"[Verse 1]
I know that you like me
And it's kinda frightenin' standin' here waitin', waitin'
And I became hypnotized
By freckles and bright eyes, tongue-tied
[Pre-Chorus]
But now, you're so far away and I'm down
Feelin' like a face in the crowd
I'm reachin' for you, terrified
[Chorus]
'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep, and I
I could be the reason you can't sleep at night
A mеssage in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' herе, hopin' it gets to you
[Verse 2]
These days I'm restless
Workdays are endless, look how you made me, made me
But time moves faster
Replayin' your laughter, disaster
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause now, you're so far away and I'm down
Feelin' like a face in the crowd
I'm reachin' for you, terrified, 'cause
[Chorus]
'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of

How is it in London? (London)
Where were you while I'm wonderin' (Wonderin')
If I'll ever see you again?
You could be the one that I love, mm-mm
And now I'm standin' here, hopin' it gets to you

Midnight Rain,"[Intro]
Rain
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight
[Verse 1]
My town was a wasteland
Full of cages, full of fences
Pageant queens and big pretenders
But for some, it was paradise
My boy was a montage
A slow-motion, love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean
I broke his heart 'cause he was nice
He was sunshine, I was midnight rain
[Chorus]
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight
[Verse 2]
It came like a postcard
Picture perfect shiny family
Holiday peppermint candy
But for him, it's every day
So I peered through a window
A deep portal, time travel
All the love we unravel
And the life I gave away
'Cause he was sunshine, I was midnight rain
[Chorus]
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight
[Outro]
I guess sometimes we all get
Just what we wanted, just what we wanted
And he never thinks of me
Except for when I'm on TV
I guess sometimes we all get
Some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted
And I never think of him
Except on midnights like this
(Midnights like this, midnights like this)"
Mine (Taylor's Version),"[Intro]
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
[Verse 1]
You were in college working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts
[Pre-Chorus]
I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lying on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now
[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
[Verse 2]
Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes
[Pre-Chorus]
But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about
[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh
[Bridge]
And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause it's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone"" (Oh)
[Chorus]
You said, ""I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""
[Post-Chorus]
Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
(Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
(Hold on) You are the best thing that's ever been mine
[Outro]
Do you believe it? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
We're gonna make it now (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I can see it (Yeah, yeah)
I can see it now"
Miss Americana & The Heartbreak Prince,
My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys,"[Verse 1]
Oh, here we go again
The voices in his head
Called the rain to end our days of wild
The sickest army doll
Purchased at the mall
Rivulets descend my plastic smile
[Pre-Chorus]
But you should've seen him when he first got me
[Chorus]
My boy only breaks his favorite toys, toys, oh
I'm queen of sand castles he destroys, oh, oh
'Cause it fit too right, puzzle pieces in the dead of night
I should've known it was a matter of time, oh, oh
My boy only breaks his favorite toys, oh, oh
[Verse 2]
There was a litany of reasons why
We could've playеd for keeps this time
I know I'm just repeating mysеlf
Put me back on my shelf
But first, pull the string
And I'll tell you that he runs
Because he loves me (He loves me)
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you should've seen him when he first saw me
[Chorus]
My boy (My boy), only breaks his favorite toys, toys, oh
I'm queen (I'm queen), of sand castles he destroys, oh, oh
'Cause I knew too much, there was danger in the heat of my touch
He saw forever, so he smashed it up, oh, oh
My boy (My boy), only breaks his favorite toys, oh, oh
[Bridge]
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh) Once I fix me
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh) He's gonna miss me
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh) Once I fix me
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh) He's gonna miss me
[Outro]
Just say when, I'd play again
He was my best friend down at the sandlot
I felt more when we played pretend
Than with all the Kens
'Cause he took me out of my box
Stole my tortured heart
Left all these broken parts
Told me I'm better off
But I'm not
I'm not, I'm not"
Never Grow Up (Taylor's Version),"[Verse 1]
Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite nightlight
[Pre-Chorus]
To you, everything's funny
You got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that
[Chorus]
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up
[Post-Chorus]
And never grow up
[Verse 2]
You're in the car, on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's droppin' you off
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
[Pre-Chorus]
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's gettin' older, too
And don't lose the way that you dance around
In your PJs getting ready for school
[Chorus]
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
And no one's ever burned you
Nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to
Just try to never grow up
[Bridge]
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is, someday, gonna be gone
[Verse 3]
So, here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on
[Chorus]
Wish I'd never grown up
Wish I'd never grown up
Oh, I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up, I could still be little
Oh, I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up, it could still be simple
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you (Never grow up)
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to
Please, try to never grow up
[Outro]
Oh, oh (Never grow up)
Just never grow up
Oh (Never grow up)
Just never grow up"
New Romantics (Taylor's Version),"[Verse 1]
We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't comin'
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better
We're so young, but we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb, but we know exactly what we're doin'
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And evеry day is like a battle
But evеry night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics, come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem, 
we sing it proudly
We are too busy dancin
' to get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free
[Verse 2]
We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding
We hang back, it's all in the timing
I
t's poker, he can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my Ace, ah
We need love, but all we want is danger
We team up, then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But, honey, most of them are true
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics, come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem, we sing it proudly
We are too busy dancin' (Yeah) to get knocked off our feet (Hey)
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free
[Post-Chorus]
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh) Oh
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh) So, come on, come along with me
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh) The best people in life are free
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
[Bridge]
Please, take my hand and
Please, take me dancin' and
Please, leave me stranded
It's so romantic (It's so romantic)
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, I could build a castle (Oh, baby, I could build a castle)
Out of all the bricks they threw at me (At me)
And every day is like a battle (Oh)
But every night with us is like a dream (Is like a dream)
'Cause baby, I could build a castle (Castle)
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle (And every day is like a battle, oh)
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics, come on, come along with me

Nothing New (feat. Phoebe Bridgers) (Taylor’s Version) (From The Vault),
Now That We Don't Talk (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault),"[Verse 1]
You went to a party
I heard from everybody
You part the crowd like the Red Sea
Don't even get me started
Did you get anxious though
On the way home?
I guess I'll never, ever know
Now that we don't talk
[Verse 2]
You grew your hair long
You got new icons
And from the outside
It looks like you're tryin' lives on
I miss the old ways
You didn't have to change
But I guess I don't have a say
Now that we don't talk
[Chorus]
I call my mom, she said that it was for the best
Remind myself, the morе I gave, you'd want me less
I cannot bе your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost
And what it cost, now that we don't talk
[Bridge]
What do you tell your friends we
Shared dinners, long weekends with?
Truth is, I can't pretend it's
Platonic, it's just ended, so
[Chorus]
I call my mom, she said to get it off my chest (Off my chest)
Remind myself the way you faded 'til I left ('Til I left)
I cannot be your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost (Of what I lost)
And what it cost, now that we don't talk
[Outro]
I don't have to pretend I like acid rock
Or that I'd like to be on a mega yacht
With important men who think important thoughts
Guess maybe I am better off now that we don't talk
And the only way back to my dignity
Was to turn into a shrouded mystery
Just like I had been when you were chasing me
Guess this is how it has to be now that we don't talk"
Ours (Taylor’s Version),"[Verse 1]
Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you
[Chorus]
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
T
he stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours
[Verse 2]
You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine
And you'll say
[Chorus]
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours
[Bridge]
And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong and
Your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong and
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Will be ignored, 'cause my heart is yours
[Chorus]
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours"
Out Of The Woods (Taylor's Version),"[Verse 1]
Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (Then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinkin'
[Chorus]
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
(Are we out of the woods?)
[Verse 2]
Looking at it now
Last December (Last December)
We were built to fall apart
And fall back together (Back together)
Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided, we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinkin'
[Chorus]
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? (Oh)
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
(Are we out of the woods?)
[Bridge]
Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in the hospital room
When you started crying, baby, I did too
But when the sun came up, I was lookin' at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat?
I walked out, I said, ""I'm settin' you free""
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up, you were lookin' at me
You were lookin' at me, oh, you were looking at me
(
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
)
(
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
)
I remember
(
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
)
(
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
)
Oh, I remember
[Chorus]
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? (Yeah)
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet? (Say, are we?)
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? (Yeah) Are we in the clear yet? (Yeah)
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good (Clear yet? Good)
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good (Do you remember?)
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good"
Paper Rings,"[Verse 1]
The moon is high
Like your friends were the night that we first met
Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
Now I've read all of the books beside your bed
The wine is cold
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe
[Pre-Chorus]
(Ayy)
Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night (Oh)
Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times 'cause I waited my whole life (One, two, one, two, three, four)
[Chorus]
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh-huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents, except when we went from friends to this
Uh-huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want
[Verse 2]
In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
When you jumped in first, I went in too
I'm with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back
To the color that we painted your brother's wall
Honey, without all the exes, fights and flaws
We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so
[Pre-Chorus]
(Ayy)
Kiss you once 'cause I know you had a long night (Oh)
Kiss you twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times 'cause you waited your whole life (One, two, one, two, three, four)
Ah
[Chorus]
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh-huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents, except when we went from friends to this
Uh-huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want
[Bridge]
I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
Uh-huh
[Chorus]
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Ah-ah, that's right, you're the one I want
I hate accidents, except when we went from friends to this
Ah-ah, darling, you're the one I want
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh-huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents, except when we went from friends to this
Uh-huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in all my dreams
You're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in all my dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

You're the one I want, one I want
You're the one I want, one I want"
Paris,"[Verse 1]
""Your ex-friend's sister
Met someone at a club and he kissed her
Turns out, it was that guy you hooked up with ages ago
Some wannabe Z-lister
And all the outfits were terrible
2003 unbearable
Did you see the photos?""
No, I didn't, but thanks, though
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so in love that I might stop breathing
Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No, I didn't see the news
'Cause we were somewhere else
Stumbled down pretend alleyways
Cheap wine, make believe it's champagne
I was taken by the view
[Chorus]
Like we were in Paris
Like we were somewhere else
Like we were in Paris, oh
We were somewhere else
[Verse 2]
Privacy sign on the door
And on my page and on the whole world
Romance is not dead if you keep it just yours
Levitate above all the messes made
Sit quiet by my side in the shade
And not the kind that's thrown
I mean, the kind under where a tree has grown
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so in love that I might stop breathing
Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No, I didn't see the news
'Cause we were somewhere else
Stumbled down pretend alleyways
Cheap wine, make believe it's champagne
I was taken by the view
[Chorus]
Like we were in Paris, oh
Like we were somewhere else
Like we were in Paris, oh
We were somewhere else
[Bridge]
I wanna brainwash you
Into loving me forever
I wanna transport you
To somewhere the culture's clever
Confess my truth
In swooping, sloping, cursive letters
Let the only flashing lights be the tower at midnight
In my mind
[Breakdown]
We drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No, I didn't see the news
'Cause we were somewhere else
In an alleyway, drinking champagne
[Chorus]
'Cause we were in Paris
Yes, we were somewhere else
My love, we were in Paris
Yes, we were somewhere else"
Question...?,"[Intro]
I remember
[Verse 1]
Good girl, sad boy
Big city, wrong choices
We had one thing goin' on
I swear that it was somethin'
'Cause I don't remember who I was
Before you painted all my nights
A color I've searched for since
But one thing after another
Fuckin' situations, circumstances
Miscommunications, and I
Have to say, by the way
I just may like some explanations
[Chorus]
Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you
But fifteen seconds later, thеy were clappin' too?
Then what did you do?
Did you lеave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question
[Verse 2]
Half-moon eyes, bad surprise
Did you realize out of time?
She was on your mind with some dickhead guy
That you saw that night
But you were on somethin'
It was one drink after another
Fuckin' politics and gender roles
And you're not sure and I don't know
Got swept away in the gray
I just may like to have a conversation
[Chorus]
Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you
But fifteen seconds later, they were clappin' too?
Then what did you do?
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question
[Bridge]
Does it feel like everything's just like
Second best after that meteor strike?
And what's that that I heard? That you're still with her?
That's nice, I'm sure that's what's suitable
And right, but tonight
[Chorus]
Can I ask you a question? (Can I ask you a question?)
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room (In a crowded room)
And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you (Makin' fun of you)
But fifteen seconds later, they were clappin' too?
Then what did you do? (Do)
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh (More of a fight)
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question"
Red (Taylor's Version),"[Verse 1]
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all
[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)
Forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red (Red, red)
(Red, red)
But loving him was red (Red, red)
(Red, red)
[Verse 2]
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong
[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)
Forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red (Red, red)
Oh, red (Red, red)
Burning red (Red, red)
(Red, red)
[Bridge]
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible when I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red
[Chorus]
Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)
Forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red (Red, red)
Yeah, yeah, red (Red, red)
Oh, burning red (Red, red)
(Red, red)
[Post-Chorus]
And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head (Red, red)
Comes back to me, burning red (Red, red)
(Red, red)
Yeah, yeah (Red, red)
[Outro]
His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street"
Ronan (Taylor's Version),"[Verse 1]
I remember your bare feet down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the Moon and back
I remember your blue eyes lookin' into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancin' before bedtime
Then jumpin' on me, waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even 
the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you
[Chorus]
""Come on, baby, with me
We're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years""
[Verse 2]
I remember the drive home when the blind hope
Turned to cryin' and screamin', ""Why?""
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And it's about to be Halloween, you could be anything
You wanted if you were still here
I remember the last day when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear
[Chorus]
""Come on, baby, with me
We're gonna fly away from here
Out of this curtained room and this hospital gray
We'll just disappear
Come on, baby, with me
We're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years""
[Bridge]
What if I'm standin' in your closet trying to talk to you?
And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
And what if the miracle was even gettin' one moment with you?
[Chorus]
Come on, baby, with me
We're gonna fly away from here
Come on, baby, with me
We're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years
[Outro]
I remember your bare feet down the hallway
I love you to the Moon and back"

Sad Beautiful Tragic (Taylor's Version),"[Verse 1]
Long handwritten notes deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait
[Chorus]
We had a beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
[Verse 2]
In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
And we both wake in lonely beds and different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons and, darlin', they all look like me
[Chorus]
'Cause wе had a beautiful, magic love therе
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
[Post-Chorus]
Woah, woah, woah, oh
[Bridge]
Distance, timin', breakdown, fighting
Silence, the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it, 
could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up and, for the life of us, we can't get back
[Chorus]
A beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, beautiful, tragic, beautiful
What we had, a beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
We had a beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair"
Say Don't Go (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault),"[Verse 1]

We’re a shot in the darkest dark
Oh no, oh no, I'm unarmed
The waiting is a sadness
Fading into madness
Oh no, oh no, it won't stop

I’m standin' on a tightrope alone
I hold my breath a little bit longer
Halfway out the door, but it won't close
I'm holdin' out hope for you to

I would stay forever if you say, ""Don't go""

Why'd you have to lead me on?

So High School,"[Verse 1]
I feel so high school every time I look at you
I wanna find you in a crowd just to hide from you
[Pre-Chorus]
And in the blink of a crinklin' eye
I'm sinkin', our fingers entwined
Cheeks pink in the twinklin' lights
Tell me 'bout the first time you saw me
I'll drink what you think and I'm high
From smokin' your jokes all damn night
The brink of a wrinkle in time
Bittersweet sixteen suddenly
[Chorus]
I'm watchin' American Pie with you on a Saturday night
Your friends are around, so be quiet
I'm tryin' to stifle my sighs
'Cause I feel so high school every time I look at you
But look at you

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah

Are you gonna marry, kiss, or kill me? (Kill me)

You knew what you wanted and, boy, you got her
Brand new, full throttle
You already know, babe

I feel like laughin' in the middle of practice
Do that impression you did of your dad again
I'm hearing voices like a madman

So (So) long (Long), London (London)
So (So) long (Long), London (London)
So (So) long (Long), London (London)
[Verse 1]
I saw in my mind fairy lights through the mist
I kept calm and carried the weight of the rift
Pulled him in tighter each time he was driftin' away
My spine split from carrying us up the hill
Wet through my clothes, weary bones caught the chill
I stopped tryna make him laugh, stopped tryna drill the safe
[Chorus]
Thinkin', ""How much sad did you think I had
Did you think I had in me?""
Oh, the tragedy
So long, London
You'll find someone
[Verse 2]
I didn't opt in to be your odd man out
I founded the club she's heard great things about
I left all I knew, you left me at the house by the Heath
I stoppеd CPR, after all, it's no use
The spirit was gonе, we would never come to
And I'm pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free
[Chorus]
For so long, London
Stitches undone
Two graves, one gun
I'll find someone
[Bridge]
And you say I abandoned the ship
But I was going down with it
My white-knuckle dying grip
Holding tight to your quiet resentment
And my friends said it isn't right to be scared
Every day of a love affair
Every breath feels like rarest air
When you're not sure if he wants to be there
[Chorus]
So how much sad did you think I had
Did you think I had in me?
How much tragedy?
Just how low did you
Think I'd go 'fore I'd self-implode?
'Fore I'd have to go be free?
[Verse 3]
You swore that you loved me, but where were the clues?
I died on the altar waitin' for the proof
You sacrificed us to the gods of your bluest days
And I'm just getting color back into my face
I'm just mad as hell 'cause I loved this place for
[Chorus]
So (So) long (Long), London (London)
Had (Had) a (A) good (Good) run (Run)
A moment (Moment) of warm sun (Sun)
But I'm (I'm) not (Not) the (The) one (One)
So (So) long (Long), London (London)
Stitches (Stitches) undone (Undone)
Two (Two) graves (Graves) one gun (Gun)

Sparks Fly (Taylor’s Version),"[Verse 1]
The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless that should send me runnin'
But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me, just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinkin' of
[Chorus]
Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
[Verse 2]
My mind forgets to remind me you're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really somethin'
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you, I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would
[Chorus]
Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
[Bridge]
I'll run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keepin' your eyes on me
It's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase, won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a fireworks show
[Chorus]
Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk (Ah-ah), take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

And the sparks fly
Oh, baby, smile

Speak Now (Taylor's Version),"[Verse 1]
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry
[Pre-Chorus]
This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say
[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""Spеak now""
[Verse 2]
Fond gestures are еxchanged
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be
[Pre-Chorus]
She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me, don't you?
[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""Speak now""
Don't say yes, run away now (Run away now)
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow (Say a single vow)
Your time is running out
And they said, ""Speak now""
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh (Run away now), la
Ooh (Say a single vow), ooh
[Bridge]
I hear the preacher say
""Speak now or forever hold your peace""
There's the silence, there's my last chance
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only lookin' at you
[Verse 3]
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl, haha
[Chorus]
So, don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
They said, ""Speak now""
And you say, ""Let's run away now (Run away now)
I'll meet you when I'm out
Of my tux, at the back door
Baby, I didn't say my vows (Say a single vow)
So glad you were around
When they said, 'Speak now'"""
Starlight (Taylor's Version),"[Chorus]
I said, ""Oh my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancin', dancin'
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight
[Verse 1]
I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picks me up late one night, out the window
We were seventeen and crazy, runnin' wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playin' whеn we walked in
The night wе snuck into a yacht club party
Pretendin' to be a duchess and a prince
[Chorus]
And I said, ""Oh my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancin', dancin'

Like we're made of starlight, starlight
[Verse 2]
He said, ""Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change""
""You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinkin' that way""
He was tryin' to skip rocks on the ocean
, saying to me
""Don't you see the starlight, starlight?""
""Don't you dream impossible things?""
[Chorus]
Like, ""Oh my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancin', dancin'
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Ooh, ooh, he's talkin' crazy
Ooh, ooh, dancin' with me
Ooh, ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream

Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams

Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?"
State Of Grace (Acoustic Version) (Taylor's Version),"[Verse 1]
I'm walkin' fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time

And I never
Saw you comin'
And I'll never
Be the same

Pierce the room like a cannonball

Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

So you were never a saint and I loved in shades of wrong

I threw my phone across the room at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning, I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said, ""Okay, let's talk
""
[Chorus]
And I said, ""Stay, stay, stay""
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay
[Verse 2]
Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me
[Chorus]
No choice but to stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay
[Bridge]
You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes and dreams
I just like hanging out with you
All the time
All those times that you didn't leave
It's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you
For my whole life
[Chorus]
Stay
And I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay
[Outro]
That's so fun"
Style (Taylor's Version),"[Verse 1]
Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive
Could end in burnin' flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
(Heard from you)
[Pre-Chorus]
I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time
[Chorus]
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashin' down, we come back every time
'Cause we nеver go out of style, we nеver go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white T-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashin' down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
[Verse 2]
So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road, mm
Takes me home
Lights are off, he's taking off his coat, oh, yeah
I say, ""I heard, oh
That you've been out and about with some other girl""
Some other girl
[Pre-Chorus]
He says, ""What you heard is true, but I
Can't stop thinkin' 'bout you,"" and I
I said, ""I've been there too a few times""
[Chorus]
'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashin' down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white T-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (A tight little skirt)
And when we go crashin' down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style (We never go, we never go), we never go out of style
[Bridge]
Take me home (Ah)
Just take me home (Ah)
Yeah, just take me home (Ah)
Woah, woah, oh (Out of style)
[Chorus]
Oh, 'cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashin' down (And when we go), we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style"
Suburban Legends (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault),"[Verse 1]
You had people who called you on unmarked numbers
In my peripheral vision
I let it slide like a hose on a slippery plastic summer
All was quickly forgiven
You were so magnetic, it was almost obnoxious
Flush with the currency of cool
I was always turnin' out my empty pockets
And when it came to you
[Chorus]
I didn't come here to make friends
We were born to be suburban legends
When you hold me, it holds me together
And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever
[Verse 2]
I had the fantasy that maybe our mismatched star signs
Would surprise the whole school
When I ended up back at our class reunion
Walkin' in with you
You'd be more than a chapter in my old diaries
With the pages ripped out
I am standin' in a 1950s gymnasium
And I can still see you now
[Chorus]
I didn't come here to make friends
We were born to be suburban legends
When you hold me, it holds me together
And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever
I know that you still remember
We were born to be national treasures
When you told me we'd get back together
And 
you kissed me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever
[Outro]
Tick-tock on the clock, I pace down your block
I broke my own heart 'cause you were too polite to do it
Waves crash on the shore, I dash to the door
You don't knock anymore and my whole life's ruined
Tick-tock on the clock, I pace down your block
I broke my own heart 'cause you were too polite to do it
Waves crash to the shore, I dash to the door
You don't knock anymore and 
I always knew it
That my life would be ruined"
Superman (Taylor’s Version),"[Verse 1]
Tall, dark, and superman
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me
He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say
And you smile and say, ""How are you?”
And I'll say, ""Just fine""
I always forget to tell you, ""I love you""
I love you forever
[Chorus]
I watch Superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
And I watch Superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down
[Verse 2]
Tall, dark and beautiful
He's complicated, he's irrational
But I hope someday you'll take me away, and save the day, yeah
Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
He's not all bad like his reputation
And I can't hear one single word they say
And you'll leave, got places to be, and I'll be okay
I always forget to tell you, ""I love you""
I loved you from the very first day
[Chorus]
I watch Superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
And I watch Superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down
[Bridge]
And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you don't save some other girl
Don't forget, don't forget about me
I'm far away, but I never let you go
I'm love-struck and looking out the window
Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be
[Breakdown]
Right here, wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you
'Cause I loved you from the very first day
[Chorus]
I watch Superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
Forever and ever
And I watch Superman fly away
I swear, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down
[Outro]
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
When you come back down"
Sweet Nothing,"[Verse 1]
I spy with my little tired eye
Tiny as a firefly
A pebble that we picked up last July
Down deep inside your pocket
We almost forgot it
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?
Ooh, ooh
[Chorus]
They said the end is comin'
Everyone’s up to somethin'
I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
Outside, they’re push and shovin'
You're in the kitchen hummin'
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'
[Verse 2]
On the way home
I wrote a poem
You say, ""What a mind""
This happens all the time
Ooh, ooh
[Chorus]
'Causе they said the end is comin'
Evеryone's up to somethin’
I find myself runnin’ home to your sweet nothings
Outside, they're push and shovin’
You're in the kitchen hummin'
All that you ever wanted from me was nothin'
[Bridge]
Industry disruptors and soul deconstructors
And smooth-talking hucksters out glad-handing each other
And the voices that implore, ""You should be doing more""
To you, I can admit that I’m just too soft for all of it
Ooh
[Chorus]
They said the end is comin'
Everyone's up to somethin'
I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
Outside, they're push and shovin'
You're in the kitchen hummin'
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'
They said the end is comin' (They said the end is comin')
Everyone's up to somethin' (Everyone's up to somethin')
I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
Outside, they're push and shovin' (Outside, they're push and shovin')
You're in the kitchen hummin' (You're in the kitchen hummin')
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'"
The Alchemy,"[Verse 1]
This happens once every few lifetimes
These chemicals hit me like white wine
What if I told you I'm back?
The hospital was a drag
Worst sleep that I ever had
I circled you on a map
I haven't come around in so long
But I'm coming back so strong
[Chorus]
So when I touch down
Call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team
Ditch the clowns, get the crown
Baby, I'm the one to beat
'Cause the sign on your heart
Said it's still reserved for me
Honestly, who are we to fight thе alchemy?
[Verse 2]
Hey, you, what if I told you we'rе cool?
That child's play back in school
Is forgiven under my rule
I haven't come around in so long
But I'm making a comeback to where I belong
[Chorus]
So when I touch down
Call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team
Ditch the clowns, get the crown
Baby, I'm the one to beat
'Cause the sign on your heart
Said it's still reserved for me
Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?
These blokes warm the benches
We've been on a winning streak
He jokes that it's heroin, but this time with an ""E""
'Cause the sign on your heart
Said it's still reserved for me
Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?
[Bridge]
Shirts off and your friends lift you up over their heads
Beer stickin' to the floor, 
cheers chanted 'cause they said
""There was no chance trying to be the greatest in the league""
Where's the trophy? He just comes runnin' over to me
[Chorus]
Touchdown
Call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team
Ditch the clowns, get the crown
Baby, I'm the one to beat
'Cause the sign on your heart
Said it's still reserved for me
Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?
These blokes warm the benches
We've been on a winning streak
He jokes that it's heroin, but this time with an ""E""
'Cause the sign on your heart
Said it's still reserved for me
Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?
[Outro]
This happens once every few lifetimes
These chemicals hit me like white wine"
The Archer,"[Verse 1]
Combat, I'm ready for combat
I say I don't want that, but what if I do?
'Cause cruelty wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you
[Pre-Chorus]
Easy they come, easy they go
I jump from the train, I ride off alone
I never grew up, it's getting so old
Help me hold on to you
[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
[Verse 2]
Dark side, I search for your dark side
But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years
[Pre-Chorus]
I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire, invisible smoke
And all of my heroes die all alone
Help me hold on to you
[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)
[Bridge]
'Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through
Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me
[Pre-Chorus]
All the king's horses, all the king's men
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies started out friends
Help me hold on to you
[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
You could stay
You could stay
[Outro]
Combat, I'm ready for combat"
The Great War,"[Verse 1]
My knuckles were bruised like violets
Sucker punching walls, cursed you as I sleep-talked
Spineless in my tomb of silence
Tore your banners down, took the battle underground
And maybe it was egos swinging
Maybe it was her
Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur
[Chorus]
All that bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, sweet dream was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember
Uh-huh, tears on the lеtter
I vowed not to cry anymore
If wе survived the Great War
[Verse 2]
You drew up some good faith treaties
I drew curtains closed, drank my poison all alone
You said I have to trust more freely
But diesel is desire, you were playing with fire
And maybe it's the past that's talking
Screaming from the crypt
Telling me to punish you for things you never did
So I justified it
[Chorus]
All that bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, the bombs were closer
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember
Uh-huh, the burning embers
I vowed not to fight anymore
If we survived the Great War
[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh, uh-huh
[Bridge]
It turned into something bigger
Somewhere in the haze, got a sense I'd been betrayed
Your finger on my hairpin triggers
Soldier down on that icy ground
Looked up at me with honor and truth
Broken and blue, so I called off the troops
That was the night I nearly lost you
I really thought I'd lost you
[Verse 3]
We can plant a memory garden
Say a solemn prayer, place a poppy in my hair
There's no morning glory, it was war, it wasn't fair
And we will never go back
[Chorus]
To that bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, the worst was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember
Uh-huh, we're burned for better
I vowed I would always be yours
'Cause we survived the Great War
[Outro]
Uh-huh, uh-huh
I will always be yours
'Cause we survived the Great War
Uh-huh
I vow I will always be yours"
The Last Time (feat. Gary Lightbody of Snow Patrol) (Taylor’s Version),
The Lucky One (Taylor's Version),"[Verse 1]
New to town with a made-up name
In the angel's city, chasin' fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight, you look like a '60s queen
[Pre-Chorus]
Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky
[Chorus]
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh
[Verse 2]
And now, it's big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you're lucky, but you're so confused
'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place
[Pre-Chorus]
Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you'll make it out alive
[Chorus]
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
[Verse 3]
It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right
[Chorus]
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-woah, oh"
The Man,"[Verse 1]
I would be complex, I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you
[Pre-Chorus]
I’d be a fearless leader, I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya, what's that like?
[Chorus]
I’m so sick of running as fast as I can
Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man (Man)
I’d be the man (Man)
[Verse 2]
They’d say I hustled, put in the work
They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves
[Pre-Chorus]
And they would toast to me, oh (Ayy), let the players play
I’d be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez
[Chorus]
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I’m so sick of them comin' at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man (Man)
I'd be the man (Man)
[Bridge]
What's it like to brag about raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models?
And it's all good if you're bad
And it's okay if you're mad
If I was out flashin' my dollars
I'd be a bitch, not a baller
They'd paint me out to be bad
So it's okay that I'm mad
[Chorus]
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
 (You know that)
And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again (Comin' at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man), then I'd be the man (Then I'd be the man)
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can (As fast as I can)
Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (Hey)
And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again (Comin' at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man), then I'd be the man
I'd be the man (Man)
I'd be the man (Man, oh)
I'd be the man (Man, yeah)
I'd be the man (Man, I'd be the man)

If I was a man
Then I'd be the man"
The Moment I Knew (Taylor's Version),"[Verse 1]
You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that ""Baby, I'm right here"" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars that just align
And I would've been so happy
Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waitin' for you to walk in
But the time is tickin'
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here
[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughin'
As I'm lookin' around the room
But therе was one thing missin'
And that was the moment I knеw
[Verse 2]
And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's somethin' really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feelin' starts
As I say hopelessly
""He said he'd be here""
[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughin'
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missin'
And that was the moment I knew
[Bridge]
What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?
[Breakdown]
You should've been here
And I would've been so happy
[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standin' around me, singin'
""Happy birthday to you""
But there was one thing missin'
And that was the moment I knew
[Post-Chorus]
(Oh) Oh, I knew
(Oh)
[Outro]
You called me later
And said, ""I'm sorry I didn't make it""
And I said, ""I'm sorry too""
And that was the moment I knew"
The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived,"[Verse 1]
Was any of it true?
Gazing at me starry-eyed
In your Jehovah's Witness suit
Who the fuck was that guy?
You tried to buy some pills
From a friend of friends of mine
They just ghosted you
Now you know what it feels like
[Chorus]
And I don't even want you back, I just want to know
If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal
And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give
A message to the smallest man who ever lived?
[Verse 2]
You hung me on your wall
Stabbed me with your push pins
In public, showed me off
Then sank in stoned oblivion
'Cause once your queen had come
You'd treat her likе an also-ran
You didn't measure up
In any measurе of a man
[Chorus]
And I don't even want you back, I just want to know
If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal
And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give
A message to the smallest man who ever lived?
[Bridge]
Were you sent by someone who wanted me dead?
Did you sleep with a gun underneath our bed?
Were you writin' a book? Were you a sleeper cell spy?
In fifty years, will all this be declassified?
And you'll confess why you did it and I'll say, ""Good riddance""
'Cause it wasn't sexy once it wasn't forbidden
I would've died for your sins, instead, I just died inside
And you deserve prison
, but you won't get time
You'll slide into inboxes and slip through the bars
You crashed my party and your rental car
You said normal girls were boring
But you were gone by the morning
You kicked out the stage lights, but you're still performing
[Outro]
And in plain sight you hid
But you are what you did
And I'll forget you, but I'll never forgive
The smallest man who ever lived"
The Story Of Us (Taylor's Version),"[Verse 1]
I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, ""They’re the lucky ones""
I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Now I'm searchin' the room for an empty seat
’Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through
[Chorus]
Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'
And I’m dyin’ to know, is it killin' you
Like it’s killin' me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since thе twist of fate
When it all broke down
And thе story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
[Post-Chorus]
Next chapter
[Verse 2]
How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and tryin’ to look busy
And you're doin' your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
How I was losin' my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should've held me
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothin'?
I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud
[Chorus]
Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
Like it's killin' me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
[Bridge]
This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you said you'd rather love than fight
[Pre-Chorus]
So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon
[Chorus]
Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
Like it's killin' me? Yeah
And I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
Like it's killin' me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
'Cause we're goin' down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

The end"
The Tortured Poets Department,"[Verse 1]
You left your typewriter at my apartment
Straight from the tortured poets department
I think some things I never say
Like, ""Who uses typewriters anyway?""
But you're in self-sabotage mode
Throwing spikes down on the road
But I've seen this episode and still loved the show
Who else decodes you?
[Chorus]
And who's gonna hold you like me?
And who's gonna know you, if not me?
I laughed in your face and said
""You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith
This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we'rе modern idiots""
And who's gonna hold you like me?
[Post-Chorus]
Nobody
No-fucking-body
Nobody
[Verse 2]
You smokеd, then ate seven bars of chocolate
We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist
I scratch your head, you fall asleep
Like a tattooed golden retriever
But you awaken with dread
Pounding nails in your head
But I've read this one where you come undone
I chose this cyclone with you
[Chorus]
And who's gonna hold you like me?
(Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you?)
And who's gonna know you like me?
(Who's gonna know you?)
I laughed in your face and said
""You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith
This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we're modern idiots""
And who's gonna hold you like me?
(Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you?)

No-fucking-body
(Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you?)
Nobody
(Who's gonna hold you? Gonna know you? Gonna troll you?)
Nobody
[Bridge]
Sometimes, I wonder if you're gonna screw this up with me
But you told Lucy you'd kill yourself if I ever leave
And I had said that to Jack about you, so I felt seen
Everyone we know understands why it's meant to be
'Cause we're crazy
So tell me, who else is gonna know me?
At dinner, you take my ring off my middle finger
And put it on the one people put wedding rings on
And that's the closest I've come to my heart exploding
[Chorus]
Who's gonna hold you? (Who?)
Me
Who's gonna know you? (Who?)
Me
And you're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith
This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we're two idiots
Who's gonna hold you?
[Post-Chorus]
Who's gonna hold you?
Who's gonna hold you?
Who's gonna hold you?
Who's gonna hold you?
Who's gonna hold you?
Who's gonna hold you?
Who's gonna hold you?
Gonna know you? 
Gonna troll you?
[Outro]
You left your typewriter at my apartment
Straight from the tortured poets department
Who else decodes you?"
The Very First Night (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault),"[Chorus]
I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night
[Verse 1]
And so it goes
Every weekend, this same party
I never go alone
And I don't seem broken-hearted
My friends all say they know
Everything I'm going through
I drive down different roads
But they all lead back to you
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause they don't know about the night in the hotel
They weren't ridin' in the car when we both fell
Didn't read the note on the Polaroid picture
They don't know how much I miss you
[Chorus]
I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night
[Verse 2]
And so it was
We never saw it comin'
Not trying to fall in love
But we did like children runnin'
Back then, we didn't know
We were built to fall apart
We broke the status quo
Then we broke each other's hearts
[Pre-Chorus]
But don't forget about the night out in L.A
Dance in the kitchen, chase me down through the hallway
No one knows about the words that we whispered
No one knows how much I miss you
[Chorus]
I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night
[Post-Chorus]
Take me away, take me away
Take me away to you, to you
Take me away, take me away
Take me away to you, to you
[Bridge]
I remember the night at the hotel
I was ridin' in the car when we both fell
I'm the one on the phone as you whisper
""Do you know how much I miss you?""
[Breakdown]
I wish that we could go back in time
And I'd say to you
""I miss you like it was the very first night""
[Chorus]
I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night
[Post-Chorus]
Take me away (Take me), take me away (Take me)
Take me away (Take me) to you, to you
Take me away (Take me), take me away (Take me)
Take me away (Take me) to you, to you"
This Love (Taylor’s Version),"[Verse 1]
Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone
[Pre-Chorus]
In silent screams, in wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this
[Chorus]
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead (Oh-oh-oh)
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me (Oh-oh-oh)
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
(Oh-oh-oh)
[Verse 2]
Tossing, turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
Baby, I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern, burning
Flickered in my mind for only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone
[Pre-Chorus]
In losin' grip, on sinking ships
You showed up just in time
[Chorus]
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead (Oh-oh-oh)
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me (Oh-oh-oh)
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark (Oh-oh-oh)
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me, oh-oh-oh
[Post-Chorus]
(This love, this love, this love, this love) Oh-oh-oh
(This love, this love, this love, this love) Oh-oh-oh
(This love, this love, this love, this love) Oh-oh-oh
(This love, this love, this love, this love)
[Bridge]
Your kiss, my cheek, I watched you leave
Your smile, my ghost, I fell to my knees
When you're young, you just run
But you come back to what you need
[Chorus]
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead (Oh-oh-oh)
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me (Oh-oh-oh)
(This love) This love left a permanent mark
(This love) This love is glowing in the dark (Oh-oh-oh)
(This love) These hands had to let it go free and
(This love) This love came back to me, oh-oh-oh
[Post-Chorus]
(This love, this love, oh, this love, this love) Oh-oh-oh
(This love, this love, this love, this love) Oh-oh-oh
(This love, this love, this love, this love)
(This love, this love, this love, this love)
This love came back to me, oh-oh-oh"
Timeless (Taylor’s Version) (From The Vault),"[Verse 1]
Down the block, there's an antique shop
And something in my head said, ""Stop,"" so I walked in
On the counter was a cardboard box
And the sign said, ""Photos: twenty-five cents each""
Black and white, saw a 30s bride
And school lovers laughin' on the porch of their first house
The kinda love that you only find once in a lifetime
The kind you don't put down
[Pre-Chorus]
And that's when I called you and it's so hard to explain
But in those photos, I saw us instead
And, somehow, I know that you and I would've found each other
In another life, you still would've turned my head even if wе'd met
[Chorus]
On a crowded street in 1944
And you werе headed off to fight in the war
You still would've been mine
We would have been timeless
I would've read your love letters every single night
And prayed to God you'd be comin' home all right
And you would've been fine
We would have been timeless
'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this
So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine
We would've been timeless
[Verse 2]
I had to smile when it caught my eye
There was one of a teenage couple in the driveway
Holdin' hands on the way to a dance
And the date on the back said 1958
Which brought me back to the first time I saw you
Time stood still like somethin' in this old shop
I thought about it as I started lookin' 'round
At these precious things that time forgot
[Pre-Chorus]
That's when I came upon a book covered in cobwebs
Story of a romance torn apart by fate
Hundreds of years ago, they fell in love, like we did
And I'd die for you in the same way if I first saw your face
[Chorus]
In the 1500s, off in a foreign land
And I was forced to marry another man
You still would've been mine
We would have been timeless
I would've read your love letters every single night
And run away and left it all behind
You still would've been mine
We would've been timeless
'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this
So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine
We would've been timeless
[Bridge]
Time breaks down your mind and body
Don't you let it touch your soul
It was like an age-old classic
The first time that you saw me
The story started when you said, ""Hello""
[Chorus]
In a crowded room a few short years ago
And sometimes there's no proof, you just know
You're always gonna be mine
We're gonna be
I'm gonna love you when our hair is turnin' gray
We'll have a cardboard box of photos of the life we've made
And you'll say, ""Oh my, we really were timeless""
[Post-Chorus]
We're gonna be timeless, timeless
You still would've been mine
We would've been
Even if we'd met on a crowded street in 1944
You still would've been mine
We would've been
[Outro]
Down the block, there's an antique shop
And somethin' in my head said, ""Stop,"" so I walked in"
Treacherous (Taylor's Version),"[Verse 1]
Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
'Til the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand
[Chorus]
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I-I-I like it
[Verse 2]
I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
All we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction
[Chorus]
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I-I-I like it
[Bridge]
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you a— get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should— think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
[Chorus]
This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I-I—
[Bridge]
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you a— get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should— think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I will follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
[Outro]
This slope is treacherous
I-I-I like it"
Vigilante Shit,"[Verse 1]
Draw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man
You did some bad things, but I'm the worst of them
Sometimes, I wonder which one'll be your last lie
They say looks can kill and I might try
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't dress for women
I don't dress for men
Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge
[Chorus]
I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
I don't dress for friends
Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge
[Verse 2]
She needed cold, hard proof, so I gave her some
She had the envelope, where you think she got it from?
Now she gets the house, gets the kids, gets the pride
Picture me thick as thieves with your ex-wife
[Pre-Chorus]
And she looks so pretty
Drivin' in your Benz
Lately, she's been dressin' for revenge
[Chorus]
She don't start shit, but she can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
She don't dress for friends
Lately, she's been dressin' for revenge
[Bridge]
Ladies always rise above
Ladies know what people want
Someone sweet and kind and fun
The lady simply had enough
[Verse 3]
While he was doin' lines and crossin' all of mine
Someone told his white-collar crimes to the FBI
[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't dress for villains
Or for innocents
I'm on my vigilante shit again
[Chorus]
I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
I don't dress for friends
Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge"
We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together (Taylor's Version),"[Verse 1]
I remember when we broke up the first time
Sayin', ""This is it, I've had enough""
'Cause, like, we hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space, what?
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, we called it off again last night, but
Ooh, this time, I'm tellin' you, I'm tellin' you
[Chorus]
We are never, evеr, ever gettin' back togеther
We are never, ever, ever gettin' back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever gettin' back together
[Post-Chorus]
Like, ever
[Verse 2]
I'm really gonna miss you pickin' fights
And me fallin' for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine (Haha)
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, you called me up again tonight, but
Ooh, this time, I'm tellin' you, I'm tellin' you (Oh)
[Chorus]
We (We) are never, ever, ever gettin' back together
We are never, ever, ever (Ever) gettin' back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (Talk to me)
But we are never, ever, ever, ever gettin' back together
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh (Yeah), ooh (Yeah)
Ooh (Yeah), oh
[Bridge]
I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say, ""Never say never""
Ugh, so he calls me up and he's, like, ""I still love you""
And I'm, like, I'm just, I mean, this is exhausting, you know?
Like, we are never getting back together
Like, ever (No)
[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever gettin' back together
We are never, ever, ever (Oh) gettin' back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (To me)
But we are never, ever, ever, ever gettin' back together
[Outro]
We (Ooh), no
Gettin' back together (Ooh)
We (Ooh), oh
Gettin' back together (Ooh), yeah
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (Talk to me)
But we are never, ever, ever, ever gettin' back together"
Welcome To New York (Taylor's Version),"[Verse 1]
Walkin' through a crowd, the village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted somethin' more
Searchin' for a sound we hadn't heard before
And it said
[Chorus]
""Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you""
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat forevermorе
The lights are so bright, but they nеver blind me, me
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
[Verse 2]
When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls
[Chorus]
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat forevermore
The lights are so bright, but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York (New York), it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
[Bridge]
Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
Like any real love, it's ever-changing
Like any true love, it drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything
[Chorus]
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat
The lights are so bright, but they never blind me
Welcome to New York, new soundtrack
It's been waitin' for you, welcome to New York
The lights are so bright, but they never blind me
Welcome to New York, so bright, they never blind me
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York"
When Emma Falls in Love (Taylor’s Version) (From The Vault),"[Verse 1]
When Emma falls in love, she paces the floor
Closes the blinds and locks the door
When Emma falls in love, she calls up her mom
Jokes about the ways that this one could go wrong
She waits and takes her time
'Cause Little Miss Sunshine always thinks it's gonna rain
When Emma falls in love, I know
That boy will never be the same
[Chorus]
'Cause she's the kind of book that you can't put down
Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town
And all the bad boys would be good boys
If they only had a chance to love her
And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her
[Verse 2]
When Emma falls in love, it's all on her face
Hangs in the air like stars in outer space
When Emma falls in love, she disappears
And we all just laugh after seein' it all these years
When Emma falls apart, it's when she's alone
She takes on the pain and bears it on her own
'Cause when Emma falls in love, she's in it for keeps
She won't walk away unless she knows she absolutely has to leave
[Chorus]
And she's the kind of book that you can't put down
Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town
And all the bad boys would be good boys
If they only had a chance to love her
And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her
[Bridge]
Well, she's so New York when she's in L.A.​​
She won't lose herself in love the way that I did
'Cause she'll call you out, she'll put you in your place
When Emma falls in love, I'm learning
[Verse 3]
Emma met a boy with eyes like a man
Turns out her heart fits right in the palm of his hand
Now he'll be her shelter when it rains
Little does he know, his whole world's about to change
[Chorus]
'Cause she's the kind of book that you can't put down
Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town
And all the bad boys would be good boys
If they only had a chance to love her
And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her
[Outro]
Yeah, between me and you, sometimes I wish I was her"
Who’s Afraid of Little Old Me?,"[Verse 1]
The who's who of ""Who's that?"" is poised for the attack
But my bare hands paved their paths
You don't get to tell me about ""sad""
[Pre-Chorus]
If you wanted me dead, you should've just said
Nothing makes me feel more alive
[Chorus]
So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
""Who's afraid of little old me?""
You should be
[Verse 2]
The scandal was contained
The bullet had just grazed
At all costs, keep your good name
You don't get to tell me you feel bad
[Pre-Chorus]
Is it a wonder I broke? Let's hear one morе joke
Then we could all just laugh until I cry
[Chorus]
So I lеap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
""Who's afraid of little old me?""
I was tame, I was gentle 'til the circus life made me mean
""Don't you worry, folks, we took out all her teeth""
Who's afraid of little old me?
Well, you should be
[Post-Chorus]
(You should be) You should be
(You should be) You should be
You should be (You should be)
You should be (You should be)
You should be
[Bridge]
So tell me everything is not about me
But what if it is?
Then say they didn't do it to hurt me
But what if they did?
I wanna snarl and show you just how disturbed this has made me
You wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised me
So all you kids can sneak into my house with all the cobwebs
I'm always drunk on my own tears, isn't that what they all said?
That I'll sue you if you step on my lawn
That I'm fearsome and I'm wretched and I'm wrong
Put narcotics into all of my songs
And that's why you're still singin' along
[Chorus]
So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
""Who's afraid of little old me?""
I was tame, I was gentle 'til the circus life made me mean
""Don't you worry, folks, we took out all her teeth""
Who's afraid of little old me?
Well, you should be
[Post-Chorus]
(You should be) You should be
(You should be) You should be
'Cause you lured me (You should be)
And you hurt me (You should be)
And you taught me
[Outro]
You caged me and then you called me crazy
I am what I am 'cause you trained me
So who's afraid of me?
Who's afraid of little old me?
Who's afraid of little old me?"
Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version),"[Verse 1]
He said, ""Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds""
I thought, ""Heaven can't help me now""
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down
[Pre-Chorus]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
[Verse 2]
I said, ""No one has to know what wе do""
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voicе is a familiar sound
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now
[Pre-Chorus]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request it is
[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (Ha, ha)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
[Bridge]
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' it down
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' (Burnin') it (It) down (Down)
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow (Follow) you (You) around (Around)
(Follow you around)

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your (Just pretend, just pretend)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (Ah-ah)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Even if it's just in your
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha"
Wonderland (Taylor's Version),"[Verse 1]
Flashin' lights
And we took a wrong turn
And we fell down a rabbit hole
You held on tight to me
’Cause nothing's as it seems
And spinning out of control
[Pre-Chorus]
Didn't they tell us, ""Don’t rush into things""?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?
Ooh, didn't it all seem new and excitin'?
I felt your arms twistin' around me
I should have slept with one eye open at night
[Chorus]
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever, eh
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
And life was never worse, but nevеr better, eh, еh
[Post-Chorus]
In Wonderland
In Wonderland
In Wonderland
In Wonderland
[Verse 2]
So, we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone or so it seemed
But there were strangers watchin'
And whispers turned to talkin'
And talking turned to screams, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
Didn’t they tell us, ""Don’t rush into things""?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Didn’t you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?
Ooh, didn't it all seem new and excitin'?
I felt your arms twistin' around me
It’s all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind
But darlin'
[Chorus]
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever, eh
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
And life was never worse, but never better, eh, eh
[Post-Chorus]
In Wonderland, eh, eh
In Wonderland
In Wonderland, woah
In Wonderland
[Bridge]
I reached for you, but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You searched the world for somethin' else
To make you feel like what we had
And in the end, in Wonderland, we both went mad
Oh
[Chorus]
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (Could last forever)
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it (Got lost in it)
And life was never worse, but never better (Never better)
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it (In Wonderland)
And we pretended it could last forever (In Wonderland)
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it (In Wonderland)
And life was never worse, but never better

"Would've, Could've, Should've","[Verse 1]
If you would've blinked, then I would've
Looked away at the first glance
If you tasted poison, you could've
Spit me out at the first chance
And if I was some paint, did it splatter
On a promising grown man?
And if I was a child, did it matter
If you got to wash your hands?
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, all I used to do was pray
Would've, could've, should've
If you'd never looked my way
[Chorus]
I would've stayed on my knees
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
At nineteen
And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering
[Verse 2]
If you never touched me, I would've
Gone along with the righteous
If I never blushed, then they could've
Never whispered about this
And if you never saved me from boredom
I could've gone on as I was
But, Lord, you made me feel important
And then you tried to erase us
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, you're a crisis of my faith
Would've, could've, should've
If I'd only played it safe
[Chorus]
I would've stayed on my knees
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
At nineteen
And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering
[Bridge]
God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb won't close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time
I can't let this go
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound won't close
I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time
[Verse 3]
If clarity's in death, then why won't this die?
Years of tearing down our banners, you and I
Living for the thrill of hitting you where it hurts
Give me back my girlhood, it was mine first
[Chorus]
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
At nineteen
And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering
[Outro]
God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb won't close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time
I can't let this go
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound won't close
I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time
Oh, God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb won't close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time
I can't let this go
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound won't close
I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time"
You Are In Love (Taylor's Version),"[Verse 1]
One look, dark room, meant just for you
Time moved too fast, you play it back
Buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke
No proof, not much, but you saw enough
Small talk, he drives, coffee at midnight
The light reflects the chain on your neck
He says, ""Look up"" and your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch, but you felt enough
[Chorus]
You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (See it with the lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love, you are in lovе
[Verse 2]
Morning, his place, burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt, he keeps his word
And for once, you lеt go of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much, but it said enough
You kiss on sidewalks, you fight, then you talk
One night, he wakes, strange look on his face
Pauses, then says, ""You're my best friend""
And you knew what it was, he is in love
[Chorus]
You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (See it with the lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love, you are in love
[Bridge]
And so it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe 'round and 'round
And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
And you understand now
Why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words
[Interlude]
'Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love, you are in love
[Chorus]
You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (See it with the lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love, you are in love (Ah)
You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you (Ah)
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you (Ah)
You can see it with the lights out (See it with the lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love, you are in love"
You Belong With Me,"[Verse 1]
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me
[Verse 2]
Walk in the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that can light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?
[Pre-Chorus]
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me
[Bridge]
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me
[Chorus]
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me
[Outro]
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me"
You Need To Calm Down,"[Verse 1]
You are somebody that I don't know
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón
And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, ""Hey, are you okay?""
[Pre-Chorus]
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones
[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down
[Verse 2]
You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night
[Pre-Chorus]
You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay
[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?
You need to calm down
[Bridge]
And we see you over there on the internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now we all got crowns
You need to calm down
[Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down (You need to calm down)
You're being too loud (You're being too loud)
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop (Can you stop?)
Like can you just not step on our gowns?
You need to calm down"
"You're On Your Own, Kid","[Verse 1]
Summer went away, still, the yearning stays
I play it cool with the best of them
I wait patiently, he's gonna notice me
It's okay, we're the best of friends
Anyway
I hear it in your voice, you're smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if it's your face
I didn't choose this town, I dream of getting out
There's just one who could make me stay
All my days
[Pre-Chorus]
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I waited ages to see you there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that you never cared
[Chorus]
You're on your own, kid
You always have been
[Verse 2]
I see the great escape,
 
so long, Daisy May
I picked the petals, he loves me not
Something different bloomed, writing in my room
I play my songs in the parking lot
I'll run away
[Pre-Chorus]
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I called a taxi to take me there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare
[Chorus]
You're on your own, kid
You always have been
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this
I hosted parties and starved my body
Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss
The jokes weren't funny
, 
I took the money
My friends from home don't know what to say
I looked around in a blood-soaked gown
And I saw something they can't take away
'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
Everything you lose is a step you take
So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it
You've got no reason to be afraid
[Chorus]
You're on your own, kid
Yeah, you can face this
You're on your own, kid
You always have been"
loml,"[Verse 1]
Who's gonna stop us from waltzing back into rekindled flames
If we know the steps anyway?
We embroidered the memories of the time I was away
Stitching, ""We were just kids, babe""
I said, ""I don't mind, it takes time""
I thought I was better safe than starry-eyed
I felt aglow like this
Never before and never since
[Chorus]
If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary
You and I go from one kiss to getting married
Still alivе, killing time at the cemеtery
Never quite buried
In your suit and tie,
 
in the nick of time
You low-down boy, you stand-up guy
You Holy Ghost, you told me I'm the love of your life
You said I'm the love of your life
About a million times
[Verse 2]
Who's gonna tell me the truth when you blew in with the winds of fate
And told me I reformed you?
When your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes
Well, you took me to hell too
And all at once, the ink bleeds
A con man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme
But I've felt a hole like this
Never before and ever since
[Chorus]
If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary
What we thought was for all time was momentary
Still alive, killing time at the cemetery
Never quite buried
You cinephile in black and white
All those plot twists and dynamite
Mr. Steal Your Girl, then make her cry
You said I'm the love of your life
[Bridge]
You shit-talked me under the table
Talkin' rings and talkin' cradles
I wish I could un-recall
How we almost had it all
Dancing phantoms on the terrace
Are they second-hand embarrassed
That I can't get out of bed
'Cause something counterfeit's dead?
It was legendary
It was momentary
It was unnecessary
Should've let it stay buried
[Chorus]
Oh, what a valiant roar
What a bland goodbye
The coward claimed he was a lion
I'm combing through the braids of lies
""I'll never leave,"" ""Never mind""
Our field of dreams engulfed in fire
Your arson's match, your somber eyes
And I'll still see it until I die
You're the loss of my life"
